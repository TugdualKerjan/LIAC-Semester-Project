Reductive eliminations involving fluoroalkyl groups have been demonstrated at higher valent states of nickel,[1, 2, 3, 4] the generation of fluoroalkyl radicals via electron transfer or atom abstraction reactions of fluoroalkyl electrophiles with nickel is known,[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] fluoroalkyl-based transmetalating reagents readily react with nickel,[13, 14, 15] and catalytic transformations involving select fluoroalkyl groups have been reported.[16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 10, 22, 6] Nickel is also an earth-abundant metal with a reasonably low cost. However, most of the aforementioned chemical transformations involving fluoroalkyl groups required nickel to bear stabilizing ligands other than solvent. While in many cases ligands can serve to tune and enable the reactivity of a nickel center, in other cases they can prevent catalysis through redistributions that affect the speciation of an active form of the nickel catalyst. Moreover, extraneous non-solvento ligands raise the cost of a chemical process and can even contribute to the air-sensitivity of the system. Given these considerations, we became interested in developing new fluoroalkylation methods with nickel that employed solvent as theonly coordinating ligand. Such reaction conditions have commonly been referred to as \"ligandless\" conditions in other systems.[22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]",

These results clearly show that upon oxidation of acetonitrile-supported nickel fluoroalkyl complexes, the fluoroalkyl groups can be transferred to organic substrates. Secondly, the electrochemical analysis of [(MeCN)Ni\\({}^{\\dagger}\\)(C\\({}_{2}\\)F\\({}_{5}\\))\\({}_{3}\\)]\\({}^{-}\\) suggests that, upon electro-oxidation to [(MeCN)\\({}_{n}\\)Ni\\({}^{\\dagger\\#}\\)(C\\({}_{2}\\)F\\({}_{5}\\))\\({}_{3}\\)], reductive hemolysis of a perfluoroethyl radical occurs, with the concomitant formation of [(MeCN)Ni\\({}^{\\dagger\\#}\\)(C\\({}_{2}\\)F\\({}_{5}\\))\\({}_{2}\\)]. This electrochemical behavior shows generality with trifluoromethyl derivatives.[29] Lastly, catalytic C-H trifluoromethylations of electron rich arenes were successfully achieved using either [(MeCN)Ni(CF\\({}_{3}\\))\\({}_{3}\\)]\\({}^{-}\\) or the related [Ni(CF\\({}_{3}\\))\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2-}\\).

The covalency was analyzed, on one hand, by changes in the concentration of the electron density at the BCP along with changes in the delocalization indices. On the other hand, energy densities show the polarization of the covalent bond by looking at the ratios between potential [V(r)] and kinetic [G(r)] energy densities, which for partial covalent bonds lie in between values of 1 and 2. The total energy density shows the degree of covalency that is represented by the level of predominance of the potential over the kinetic energy density [42].",

Here, we demonstrate a new class of \\(\\upmu\\)PADs that generate colorimetric signals at the interfaces of converging liquid fronts (i.e., lines) to control where colorimetric signals are formed without relying on capture techniques. We demonstrate our approach by developing assays for three classes of analytes--an ion, an enzyme, and a small molecule--using iron (III), acetylcholinesterase, and lactate, respectively. Additionally, we show these devices have the potential to support multiplexed assays by generating multiple lines in a common readout zone.

This choice allowed us to decouple the effects of acidity and coordination modulation and to evaluate the advantages of our approach over the already established use of HF. Whereas the increase of H\\({}_{3}\\)O\\({}^{*}\\) concentration has positive effects on the crystallinity in general, the -10 \\(\\upmu\\)m average crystal size observed by using HCI increases 4-fold with HF and 8-fold with oxalic acid (Figure 1a, Figures S3-S8), suggesting that the anion's coordinative capabilities have the most significant influence. However, in the case of fluoride modulation, the crystal size was not the only observed change as X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) patterns show the presence of a secondary phase (Figure 1b). This is supported by the appearance of a secondary combustion process in the thermogravimetric profiles (Figure S37).

This is further corroborated by the absence of structured diffuse scattering in high-resolution SCXRD data from contaminated crystals (Figures S54-S55)[40, 41].

These MOFs were synthesized using 0.5, 1, and 1.5 oxalic acid:Al ratios to study how the amount of modulator affects the crystallinity of the products. In all the studied systems, oxalic acid leads to an increased crystal size with respect to the unmodulated synthesis (Figure 2, Figures S9-S23). Interestingly, a higher modulator-to-Al ratio does not always result in improved crystallinity. Indeed, in the cases of OH- and CH\\({}_{3}\\)O-MIL-53, an excessive amount of modulator leads to the stabilisation of a specific size or the absence of solid products, respectively. This behaviour can be attributed to the electron-donor character of OH and CH\\({}_{3}\\)O groups[45], which lowers the acidity of terephthalatic acid by destabilising its conjugated base[46]. Additionally, the pH decrease due to the MOF synthesis and to the formation of aluminium oxalate complexes further disfavours the deprotonation of the linkers, thus diminishing their reactivity. Our results show that the combination of these effects can allow for the tuning of the product's size distribution, in addition to its crystallinity.

The model presented here indicates spin-phonon coupling terms are governed by the magnitude of the metal-based spin-orbit coupling (SOC) constant, excited state mixing of orbital angular momentum into the ground state, and dynamic relativistic nephelaavetic contributions. The latter contribution is directly related to the covalencies of ligand-metal bonds and can modify the metal-based SOC constant from that of the free ion in a dynamic manner. Also, correlations between dynamic ground state orbital angular momentum and excited state coupling terms and their relations to spin-phonon coupling terms are drawn for the first time. Specific group theoretical correlations between high and lower symmetry point groups further provide a means to evaluate spin-phonon coupling terms across transition metal complexes and molecular qubits featuring different ligand sets, geometries, and coordination numbers.

Furthermore, while no other modes exhibited substantial linear coupling terms in the \\(D_{4h}\\) structure, from the spin-phonon analyses in Figure 2B, the \\(a_{1}\\)_(1)_ mode (mode 1 in both \\(D_{4h}\\) and \\(D_{2d}\\); \\(b_{2u}\\) in \\(D_{4h}\\)) becomes activated and linear in the \\(D_{2d}\\) structure. For the \\(a_{1}\\)_(1)_ mode, the linear fit along the vibrational mode, \\(Q_{i}\\), provides a slope of 0.140 g\\({}_{z}\\)/\\(Q_{i}\\).

In the \\(D_{4h}\\) structure, the excited state that can SOC with the ground state is at an energetic maximum along the \\(b_{2u}\\) (in \\(D_{4h}\\)) mode connecting the \\(D_{4h}\\) and \\(D_{2d}\\) structure.

This is anticipated to be especially important for local mode contributions to decoherence, as the \\(a_{I}\\)_(1)_ mode is the lowest energy mode in these structures and thus can become populated at relatively low temperatures. Indeed, all Cu(II)-based qubits in the literature are roughly square planar, \\(D_{4h}\\). Insightful and quantitative comparisons can be drawn between the vibrational analyses of the total symmetric breathing modes of the \\(D_{4h}\\) and \\(D_{2d}\\) structures, with the latter exhibiting a larger spin-phonon coupling term. This larger coupling term occurs even though the excited state coupling term (Figure 4a) is larger than the \\(D_{2d}\\) structure. The activation of the \\(a_{I}\\)_(1)_ mode for the \\(D_{2d}\\) structure and its excited state coupling behavior can be understood via the qualitative potential energy surfaces in Figure 4b. Given the ground state structure of [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- in the absence of any structural constraints is \\(D_{2d}\\), going to the \\(D_{4h}\\) structure on the ground state surfaces results in a scenario where there is a relatively small gradient in the excited state potential energy surfaces.

The \\(a_{I}\\)_(1)_ mode can be described by the Cl-Cu-Cl bond angle, \\(\\alpha\\), while the \\(a_{I}\\)_(2)_ mode can be described by the Cu-Cl bond distance.
