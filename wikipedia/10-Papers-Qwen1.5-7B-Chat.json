However, most of the aforementioned chemical transformations involving fluoroalkyl groups required nickel to bear stabilizing ligands other than solvent. While in many cases ligands can serve to tune and enable the reactivity of a nickel center, in other cases they can prevent catalysis through redistributions that affect the speciation of an active form of the nickel catalyst. Moreover, extraneous non-solvento ligands raise the cost of a chemical process and can even contribute to the air-sensitivity of the system. Given these considerations, we became interested in developing new fluoroalkylation methods with nickel that employed solvent as theonly coordinating ligand. Such reaction conditions have commonly been referred to as \"ligandless\" conditions in other systems.[22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]",

The fluidic network patterned into the device splits a single sample inlet into separate and ultimately opposing channels. Analytes can undergo partial reactions with unique reagents stored in each channel. The products of these partial reactions are directed towards a common test zone. Others have shown paper devices designed for the sequential, timed delivery of reagents from multiple channels that are directed towards a test zone.[38, 39] In these devices, flow is continuous as long as sufficient volume is available to saturate the paper. Because paper-based devices are inherently self-metering,[5] if a single channel is split and recombined, net fluid flow stops when the advancing fluid fronts meet. At this interface between fronts, where reactions between previously separated reagents are now possible and controlled by diffusion, assay products can be isolated without affinity-based capture and lead to the formation of colorimetric signals that are confined to the contour of the interface. Using this device design strategy, we demonstrate the detection of multiple classes of analytes--ions, small molecules, and enzymes--by producing line-format signals like those provided by LFTs but resulting from soluble reaction products. We demonstrate our approach by developing assays for iron (III), acetylcholinesteraseiesterase, and lactate.

We tested both the effect of different EDTA and Ferrozine concentrations on the signal to background ratio (Table S3, Table S4). As the concentration of Ferrozine increased, the intensities of both the signal formed at the readout zone and the background increased. The increase in background intensity did not negatively impact the signal to background ratio, which increased proportionally with the concentration of Ferrozine.

We chose AChE as a model analyte to evaluate how interfaces were formed when reactions were governed by two time-dependent processes: (i) the activity of the enzyme (i.e., the analyte) and (ii) diffusion and mixing of reactants across the interface. To detect AChE, we stored acetylcholine chloride and 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB, Ellman's reagent) on opposite sides of the reagent storage layer (Figure S6).

The addition of hydrazine buffer on the fourth layer of the device was to neutralize the co-produced pyruvate (Figure S7)[54]. For the lactate assay, the detected concentration range was 2-50 mM (Figure 5B). Unlike Fe(lll) and AChE assays, we analyzed results of lactate assay approximately 4 minutes after sample addition to avoid increased background signal over time.

Since the assay involves enzymatic reactions, we analyzed the results by nonlinear regression using a growth and saturation model. The data showed a nearly linear relationship between signal intensity (green channel) at concentrations of lactate less than 20 mM. At higher concentrations of lactate, the signal saturated and resulted in detectable but not quantifiable signal (Figure 5C).

Indeed, in the cases of OH- and CH\\({}_{3}\\)O-MIL-53, an excessive amount of modulator leads to the stabilisation of a specific size or the absence of solid products, respectively.

This remarkable adaptability can be attributed to oxalic acid's dual role in metal binding and protonation, offering precise control over MOF nucleation and crystal development. The unique five-membered ring chelation of oxalic acid contrasts with the linker's coordination pattern in the studied systems, allowing for modulation without causing substitutional defects. Conversely, modulators like fluoride or monocarboxylates, which exhibit similar coordination abilities, do not share these benefits. Further exploration of oxalic acid's potential in modulating other AI-MOFs and those with different metal compositions is essential to thoroughly evaluate its versatility and uncover specific advantages unique to each MOF system."

While these expressions define the zero temperature magnitudes of spin-phonon coupling terms in S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) complexes, they can be expanded to consider additional dynamic effects through the variance of g\\({}_{z}\\), \\(\\langle g_{z}^{2}\\rangle\\), which highlights the importance of the first derivative, \\(\\frac{\\partial g_{z}}{\\partial q_{l}}\\), and therefore its role in the coherence lifetimes of S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) transition metal complexes. This suggests that, without considering thermal population, odd modes such as totally symmetric stretches will have a more substantial effect on spin-phonon coupling terms and decoherence compared to even modes, in which their value of relevance, \\(\\frac{\\partial^{2}g_{z}}{\\partial q_{l}^{2}}\\), only appears in the second order term of the Taylor expansion (equation 5). The fundamental behavior of these expressions were borne out by an extensive range of DFT and TD-DFT calculations on minimalistic S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) models, \\(D_{4h}\\)/\\(D_{2d}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- and \\(C_{\\mathcal{H}}\\) [VOCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)-. Together, the results above provide a general description of the roles of transition metal geometric and electronic structure in spin-phonon coupling. For instance, the magnitudes of spin-phonon coupling terms are strongly influenced by excited state SOC of orbital angular momentum into the ground state and are predicted to be strongly influenced by the energy of the particular ligand field excited state mixing with the ground state (equations 6 and 7) (e.g., \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{2g}\\) for a \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{1g}\\) ground state in \\(D_{4h}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)-). This excited state SOC contribution is governed by the ligand field geometry about the metal complex. For example, going from \\(D_{4h}\\) to \\(D_{2d}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- turns on additional mode coupling terms due to the enhancement of excited state coupling terms (Figure 4). Furthermore, the magnitude of spin-phonon coupling terms are strongly influenced by the covalency of ligand-metal bonds. This dynamic effect largely reflects a relativistic nephelauxetic effect, which effectively modulates the SOC constant of the metal from that of the free ion. In short, the more covalent the ligand-metal bond, the smaller the spin-phonon coupling terms become. Relatedly, a significant overall reduction in SOC constant can of course be achieved through the use of different transition metal complexes (e.g., V(IV) vs. Cu(II) vs. Cr(V)). As shown below, V(IV), which has a significantly lower SOC constant than Cu(II), can still maintain favorable spin-phonon coupling terms despite having significantly more ionic ligand-metal bonds than Cu(II) complexes. Complications can also arise from trying to quantify spin-phonon coupling terms in different ligand field environments, as the nature of the modes can change. However, this can be facilitated to some degree by leveraging specific group theoretical correlations as demonstrated here for \\(D_{4h}\\), \\(D_{2d}\\), and \\(C_{\\mathcal{H}}\\) transition metal complexes. The spin-phonon analyses presented above for [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- and [VOCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- are now extended to a range of S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) Cu(II) and V(IV) molecular qubit candidates.",

Very recently, Albino et al.[13] pointed to the role of increased excited state SOC in six coordinate complexes relative to vandyl complexes. Furthermore, Fataftah et al.[33] compared six coordinate V(IV) complexes to Cu(II) complexes to suggest the role of increased covalency in elongating \\(T_{I}\\) relaxation lifetimes.

Thus, the longer spin-lattice relaxation time at higher temperatures for Cu(bdt)\\({}_{2}\\) vs. V(bdt)\\({}_{3}\\) is not due to differences in ligand-metal covalency, but rather stems from efficient excited state SOC as a result of the relatively low energy ligand field transition energies for V(bdt)\\({}_{3}\\). This is further supported by the observation of room temperature coherence in vandylcomplexes,[37] despite ionic ligand metal bonding.

The spin-phonon coupling in odd vibrational modes, particularly the totally symmetric stretch, significantly affects decoherence times. Our theoretical framework, derived from ligand field theory, allows prediction of these interactions and their relation to spectroscopic measurements. Notably, the study highlights the significance of considering ligand field strain, orbital overlap, and bond covalency in assessing different complexes' spin-phonon couplings. The proposed model provides a quantitative tool to evaluate spin-phonon coupling for specific vibrational modes in molecules with half-integer spins, serving as a benchmark for potential qubit systems.

            "input_text": "Helicene is a class of chiral n-conjugated molecules with a screw-shaped skeleton formed by _ortho_-fused benzene rings (_i.e._, phenanthrene units) that has been actively studied.[1] In addition to the chiroptical properties such as circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL),[2] their physical properties as molecular springs[3] and the CISS effect[4] are cutting-edge functionalities based on the helical molecular scaffold. When focusing on the lengths of [n]carbholeicenes, it is assumed that the overlap of the n-planes becomes more significant by forming a layered structure; double layered at n = 7 and triple layered at n = 13. In 2015, [16]carbobielcene (A) was synthesized by Murase and Fujita, and this is the longest [n]carbobielcene ever synthesized (Figure 1).[5] The synthesis of longer helicenes has been desired simply as a synthetic challenge and various improved synthetic methods have been devised.[1-6] Helicenes comprising more than triple-layered structures are particularly difficult to synthesize, because of solubility issues, and because the middle-layered core is tightly compressed, making it difficult to release the strain. Recently, several longer helicene analogues that can release the strain by virtue of their structure have been developed. For example, expanded helicenes, in which phenanthrene units are partially replaced by anthracine units to increase the diameter of helicenes,[6] and perylene bisimide-incorporated helicenes (helicene nanoribbons) have been synthesized.[7] These \"diameter-expanded\" helicene analogues display interesting dynamic behavior and chiroptical properties. Tilly's group synthesized expanded [n]helicenes (B) with three different lengths (n = 15, 19, 23), and compared the racemization barriers and dissymmetry factors.[8] By contrast, Hirose and Matsuda have reported \"n-extended\" [n]carbobielcenes (C) with three different lengths (n = 5, 7, 9), and compared their chiroptical properties, aromaticity, and ultrafast dynamics in the excited state.[9] As another type of helicene analog, heterobielcenes, in which heteroatoms are embedded into the helicene backbones, have also attracted attention because of their excellent luminescence and redox properties.[10; 11] Generally, heterohelicenes are more electron-rich compared with carbobielcenes, thus their HOMO energy levels are continuously destabilized with the n-extension. Therefore, it is more difficult to synthesize longer heterohelicenes with full conjugation, whereas several heterohelicenes with a double-layered structure have been synthesized; one example is diazatri-oxa-[13]helicene D.[12] Furthermore, a triple-layered structure was accomplished with oxa[n]helicene E (n = 17, 19) albeit with disrupted n-conjugation.[13] To qualitatively evaluate the electronic properties of helicenes, however, it is necessary to systematically synthesize fully conjugated heterohelicenes of different lengths, therefore, a synthetic strategy toward longer heterohelicene would be indispensable. Currently, few systematic synthetic methods are available for the synthesis of heterohelicenes.",

Apart from optical activities like circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), they exhibit intriguing mechanical properties akin to molecular springs and the Charge-Induced Stereoselective Separation (CISS) effect. The size of these helices, measured by the number of carboleicene rings, increases with layers: double layered at n=7 and triply layered at n=13. A milestone in the field was achieved in 2015 when Murase and Fujita synthesized the longest helicene, [16]carbobielcene (A), with 16 carbon rings (Figure 1). The synthesis of longer helicenes has been not only a synthetic challenge but has also led to the development of innovative methodologies.

The structures are shown in Figure 2A in which the solvent molecules coordinated to the NH moiety via hydrogen bonds are omitted. Because of the sophisticated molecular design, intermolecular interactions between [n]AHs were not observed in any of the structures, thereby contributing good solubility. Indeed, five and seven acetone molecules were included in the asymmetric units of [13]AH and [15]AH, respectively, (Figures S5-4, 5-5) whereas seven 1,4-dioxane molecules were included in the asymmetric unit of [19]AH (Figure S5-7). For [9]AH, the vertical distance (interplanar distance) between the centroid of terminal benzene ring A and the mean plain of the opposite terminal benzene ring I is 3.807 A. As the typical distance of \\(\\pi\\)-stacking is approximately 3.4 A, interlayer interaction between the terminal benzene rings may be minimal, similarly to that of [7]carbobilecene (3.8-3.9 A).[20] The interplanar angle between the stacked two benzene rings is approximately 40\\({}^{\\circ}\\), which also suggests that the interlayer \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interaction is weak. By contrast, for [11]AH, the longest and shortest vertical distances are 3.567 A and 3.202 A, respectively, suggesting a distinct interlayer \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interaction between the stacked aromatic rings. The interplanar angles are 16.3\\({}^{\\circ}\\), 11.6\\({}^{\\circ}\\), and 20.4\\({}^{\\circ}\\), being smaller than that of [9]AH in accordance with the effective interlayer \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions. The crystal structures of [13]AH and [15]AH are also shown in Figure 2A. As the space group is _P3\\({}_{2}\\)_ for the former and the lattice contains only one enantiomer, spontaneous chiral resolution took place for [13]AH upon crystallization. Chiral separation using HPLC apparatus is discussed later. In [13]AH and [15]AH, the shortest interplanar distances are less than 3.2 A (3.199 A and 3.176 A), and the aromatic rings are very closely packed together, again confirming the existence of effective \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions. The smallest interplanar angles are 3.3\\({}^{\\circ}\\) and 1.4\\({}^{\\circ}\\) for [13]AH and [15]AH, respectively. These values are even smaller than those of [11]AH. The crystal structures of [17]AH and [19]AH are the first examples of triple-layered fully conjugated heterobilenes. In both [17]AH and [19]AH, the shortest interplanar distances are also less than 3.2 A (3.170 A and 3.185 A, respectively), and the smallest interplanar angles are the smallest of those measured (1.2\\({}^{\\circ}\\) and 0.8\\({}^{\\circ}\\)). The interplanar angles at the ends are larger than those of the helicene central core due to the effect of electron repulsion and smaller steric constraints ([19]AH; \\(\\theta_{\\rm{A}}\\) = 19.5\\({}^{\\circ}\\), \\(\\theta_{\\rm{BN}}\\) = 0.81\\({}^{\\circ}\\)). However, at the center of the helicene core, the angles are almost 0\\({}^{\\circ}\\), because the central layers of [17]AH and [19]AH are located under large steric constraints from the top and bottom layers. After six types of crystal structures were obtained, their structural parameters of them (interplanar distance, interplanar angle, and dihedral angle) were compared with those of the obtained structures calculated at the B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-SVP level (Fig 2B).[21, 22] For all the parameters, the trend of the experimentally determined values agreed with those obtained from the theoretical calculations, which reproduced the notable changes from [9]AH to [11]AH. This result reflects the weak intramolecular \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions at the terminal aromatic ring of helicenes. A decrease in the interplanar distances or angles results in an increase in the dihedral angles, indicating that the intramolecular interactions become stronger and the aromatic rings become more densely stacked with helicene elongation, while the strain energies of the [n]AHs increase with helicene elongation. To estimate the inherent strain energy of [n]AHs, we attempted to adopt a homodesmotic reaction model.[23] Accordingly, the strain energy (_AH_) of [n]AHs increased continuously as the number _n'_ increased (Figure S7-12). These estimations are in accordance with several cases of expanded helicenes previously reported.[60] Finally, the interlayer \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions of [n]AHs between the two neighboring layers were visualized using the noncovalent interaction (NCI) plot analysis (Figures 2A and S7-11).[24] Dispersion interactions between the two stacked layers of [n]AHs are obvious (green surface shows intramolecular \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions). In particular, intramolecular \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions across three layers was confirmed for [17]AH and [19]AH.",

Nevertheless, the as-synthesized [19]AH was purified using flash chromatography on silica at room temperature and recrystallized from THF/_n_-hexane, allowing the growth of single crystals under ambient conditions (_vide supra_). Molecular orbital calculations were performed for the optimized structures of [n]AH in the ground state (Figure 4). The HOMO energy level gradually increased as the helical length increased.

As part of this work, we curate a diverse database of over 400 reference species from the available literature for use in fitting BACs or to participate in IDRs, and also provide AECs and BACs for 15 commonly used levels of theory using the workflow implemented. When comparing the approaches, we find that both BAC types yield results of similar accuracy, though the Anantharaman and Melius-type BACs seem to generalize better. Further, although the IDRs approach is often as accurate as the BAC approaches and sometimes even more advantageous, we find that this method appears to be less robust than the BAC methods. In particular, the accuracy of the IDRs approach is sensitive to the chosen reference species and reactions. Therefore, in addition to providing the automated AECs and BACs fitting procedure, we also propose improved methods to select IDRs.",

Experiments can provide high-accuracy results, often yielding data accuracy within 0.1 kcal/mol or better. However, usually several experiments need to be combined to obtain accurate thermochemical parameters reported in standard states. Moreover, many species (especially radicals, but not exclusively) cannot be isolated conveniently for experimentation. Due to the importance of these parameters, several databases exist that provide high-accuracy thermochemistry data. One widely used database is the Active Thermochemical Table (ATcT)[1, 2], which aims to produce a self-consistent set of species thermochemistry with continually improving accuracy. When data from ATcT or other high-quality experimental sources are available, they represent the preferred route for obtaining the most accurate thermochemical values of a species of interest. However, entries in ATcT represent only a minuscule fraction of all species of interest in the vast chemical universe. Given that experiments are often time-consuming, particularly if they require synthesizing the species of interest, computing species thermochemistry through quantum mechanical (QM) calculations can prove quite valuable.",

Unfortunately, many unstable compounds, particularly radicals, are challenging to isolate for laboratory experiments. Recognizing their significance, numerous databases have emerged to house high-precision thermodynamic data. The Active Thermochemical Table (ATcT), a well-known resource, strives for continuous improvement in generating a unified and reliable set of species properties.

For example, the domain-based local pairwise natural orbital (DLPNO) coupled cluster (CC) methods [3, 4] promise to deliver CC accuracy of less than 1 kcal/mol for molecules much larger than what has previously been feasible with classical CC methods. However, to realize the accuracy gains, it is well-known that energy corrections are needed in addition to the QM calculations to reduce residual errors present from the given level of theory (LOT). Usually, atomization energy corrections (AECs) are needed to correct for the large systematic errors in the computed absolute energies of atoms, and to connect the computed zero of energy to the standard state zero of energy used when defining the enthalpy of formation (a.k.a. heats of formation) \\(\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{f}}\\). As we show later in this work, if no additional corrections are used, the resulting \\(\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{f}}\\) tends to have a fairly wide distribution of errors, often not centered around zero. The need for additional corrections is well-known, and in fact, such corrections have already been derived for some DLPNO methods [5].",

However, to fully harness these improvements, it's crucial to address the residual errors inherent in the chosen level of theory (LOT). Atomization energy corrections (AECs), for instance, are essential to rectify significant systematic biases in the computed absolute energies of individual atoms and align the calculated zero energy with the standard state reference for enthalpy of formation (ΔHf), commonly referred to as heats of formation. Our study later underscores the necessity for such corrections, as failing to do so often results in a broad range of error distributions that are significantly deviated from zero. The requirement for additional AECs is widely acknowledged, and they have indeed been developed for certain DLPNO methodologies [5]."

Recently, delta machine learning (\\(\\Delta\\)-ML) techniques have been applied to this type of problem [6]. However, while ML methods have gained popularity, they often lack the interpretability intrinsic to classic strategies. In this study, our emphasis will be placed on two conventional methods. The first approach involves the use of bond additivity corrections (BACs). BAC methods assume that the residual error from QM calculations can be attributed to errors associated with specific types of bonds within a molecule. Further, the errors associated with a particular type of bond (e.g., a C-C single bond) are assumed to be largely consistent across various molecules that contain the same bond type. Therefore, a correction value can be fitted for each bond type found in a collection of reference molecules, and the total bond additivity correction is simply the sum of these corrections for every bond in a species of interest. In this work, we focus on two popular implementations of BAC: those of Petersson et al. [7] and those of Anantharaman and Melius [8]. For brevity, below we call the Anantharaman & Melius' BAC's \"Melius-type\" or \"m-BAC\", although we note that Melius had success with several different types of BACs during his long career [9]. Similarly, we will denote Petersson's BAC as \"Petersson-type\" or \"p-BAC\".",

One recent development is the utilization of delta machine learning (Δ-ML), which has gained traction in this field [10]. Nevertheless, despite their increasing adoption, machine learning models often lack the transparency inherent in classical methodologies. This research centers on two traditional approaches. The first method employs bond additivity corrections (BACs), which postulate that the discrepancies in quantum mechanical calculations can be attributed to bond-specific errors in molecules. These errors are hypothesized to be relatively consistent across similar bonds across various compounds. Consequently, individual correction factors are derived for each bond type found in a library of reference molecules, and the total bond additivity correction is calculated by summing these adjustments for all bonds in a target molecule. In this study, we shall particularly examine two well-known implementations of BAC, referred to as 'Melius-type' or 'm-BAC' after Anantharaman and Melius [11], and 'Petersson-type' or 'p-BAC' following the methodology of Petersson et al.

The IDRs approach has the advantage of being insensitive to the AECs since they cancel out when computing heats of reaction. The IDRs approach has been used to calculate accurate enthalpy of formation for large molecules such as C\\({}_{60}\\) and corannulene [12]. Recent breakthroughs have been made in this avenue, with the work of Buerger et al.

This method has successfully been applied to determine the enthalpy of formation for extensive molecules like C60 and corannulene (ref 12). Notable progress has been achieved recently, as reported by Buerger et al. (ref 13), who demonstrated a systematic and automated method to discover isodesmic reactions, eliminating the need for manual design, which was previously standard practice.

The coordination number for the atoms connected by the bond is then used to define a bond feature that separates different types of bonds. Take single C-C bond of ethane as an example, where the carbon atoms on two sides of this bond both have a coordination number of 3 (notice that by convention the carbon-carbon bond in question is excluded from the calculation of coordination number). However, for the single C-C bond in propylene, the \\(sp^{3}\\) carbon atom has a coordination number of 3 but the other \\(sp^{2}\\) carbon atom only has a coordination number of 2.

For instance, in ethane, the C-C bond has both carbon atoms with a coordination number of three, whereas in propylene, the \\(sp^3\\) carbon has three and the \\(sp^2\\) one has two. Consequently, the C-C single bond in these compounds is differentiated.

Each data point represents a single reference species that was able to be calculated both by BACs and isodesmic reactions. This gets around the issue of separate populations, and allows for a fair comparison between the method. Furthermore, an abundance of points above or below the parity line tells us which method is performing better most of the time. The parity plot comparing cross-validation errors of Melius-type BACs and isodesmic reactions found using Equation (8) can be seen in Figure 10. All of the data correspond to LOT F, and are separated out by the various reactions classes (strictly held, so any RC3 reactions are not also RC4). Comparing these two methods, it appears that the species appear above the parity line (favoring isodesmic reactions) slightly more often than they appear below it (favoring BACs), though this observation is not consistent across all reaction classes. Nonetheless, averaging the errors for BACs and isodesmic reactions for these species yields an advantage of essentially zero, suggesting that both methods are roughly on-par performance-wise. That being said, we are still left with the fact that Melius-type BACs work for all species, which is not true of the isodesmic reaction approach, giving Melius-type BACs a significant advantage.",

The parity plot in Figure 10, derived from the cross-validation errors outlined in Equation (8), consolidates the information for LOT F, categorizing them by different reaction types (excluding those that belong to both RC3 and RC4). Upon examination, it becomes evident that the species tend to cluster above the parity line, favoring isodesmic reactions, but not uniformly across all reaction classes. Despite this, the average error for BACs and isodesmic reactions is nearly indistinguishable, indicating equivalent performance.

Either way, it may be possible to predict which species have especially low errors at a given level of theory based on if they can be calculated using a higher order isodesmic reaction scheme.",

The underlying reason for this phenomenon remains uncertain - whether it's due to the enhanced representation of target species in the reference database, which possibly benefits Melius-type BACs, or if these well-represented species inherently exhibit better prediction by the given theoretical level.
