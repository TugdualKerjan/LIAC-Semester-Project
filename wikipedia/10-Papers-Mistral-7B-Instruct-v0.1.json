However, most of the aforementioned chemical transformations involving fluoroalkyl groups required nickel to bear stabilizing ligands other than solvent. While in many cases ligands can serve to tune and enable the reactivity of a nickel center, in other cases they can prevent catalysis through redistributions that affect the speciation of an active form of the nickel catalyst. Moreover, extraneous non-solvento ligands raise the cost of a chemical process and can even contribute to the air-sensitivity of the system. Given these considerations, we became interested in developing new fluoroalkylation methods with nickel that employed solvent as theonly coordinating ligand. Such reaction conditions have commonly been referred to as \"ligandless\" conditions in other systems.[22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]",

Analytes can undergo partial reactions with unique reagents stored in each channel. The products of these partial reactions are directed towards a common test zone. Others have shown paper devices designed for the sequential, timed delivery of reagents from multiple channels that are directed towards a test zone.[38, 39] In these devices, flow is continuous as long as sufficient volume is available to saturate the paper.

At this interface between fronts, where reactions between previously separated reagents are now possible and controlled by diffusion, assay products can be isolated without affinity-based capture and lead to the formation of colorimetric signals that are confined to the contour of the interface. Using this device design strategy, we demonstrate the detection of multiple classes of analytes--ions, small molecules, and enzymes--by producing line-format signals like those provided by LFTs but resulting from soluble reaction products.

In all the studied systems, oxalic acid leads to an increased crystal size with respect to the unmodulated synthesis (Figure 2, Figures S9-S23).

This model is derived from the first and second derivatives of the LFT expressions of g-values given in Section 2.1[54].

This suggests that, without considering thermal population, odd modes such as totally symmetric stretches will have a more substantial effect on spin-phonon coupling terms and decoherence compared to even modes, in which their value of relevance, \\(\\frac{\\partial^{2}g_{z}}{\\partial q_{l}^{2}}\\), only appears in the second order term of the Taylor expansion (equation 5).

Together, the results above provide a general description of the roles of transition metal geometric and electronic structure in spin-phonon coupling. For instance, the magnitudes of spin-phonon coupling terms are strongly influenced by excited state SOC of orbital angular momentum into the ground state and are predicted to be strongly influenced by the energy of the particular ligand field excited state mixing with the ground state (equations 6 and 7) (e.g., \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{2g}\\) for a \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{1g}\\) ground state in \\(D_{4h}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)-). This excited state SOC contribution is governed by the ligand field geometry about the metal complex. For example, going from \\(D_{4h}\\) to \\(D_{2d}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- turns on additional mode coupling terms due to the enhancement of excited state coupling terms (Figure 4). Furthermore, the magnitude of spin-phonon coupling terms are strongly influenced by the covalency of ligand-metal bonds. This dynamic effect largely reflects a relativistic nephelauxetic effect, which effectively modulates the SOC constant of the metal from that of the free ion. In short, the more covalent the ligand-metal bond, the smaller the spin-phonon coupling terms become. Relatedly, a significant overall reduction in SOC constant can of course be achieved through the use of different transition metal complexes (e.g., V(IV) vs. Cu(II) vs. Cr(V)). As shown below, V(IV), which has a significantly lower SOC constant than Cu(II), can still maintain favorable spin-phonon coupling terms despite having significantly more ionic ligand-metal bonds than Cu(II) complexes. Complications can also arise from trying to quantify spin-phonon coupling terms in different ligand field environments, as the nature of the modes can change. However, this can be facilitated to some degree by leveraging specific group theoretical correlations as demonstrated here for \\(D_{4h}\\), \\(D_{2d}\\), and \\(C_{\\mathcal{H}}\\) transition metal complexes. The spin-phonon analyses presented above for [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- and [VOCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- are now extended to a range of S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) Cu(II) and V(IV) molecular qubit candidates.",

The slopes and coefficients for CuPc are increased further relative to the other Cu(II) complexes, as the Cu-N bonds are significantly more ionic than the Cu-S bonds of Cu(mnt)\\({}_{2}\\), Cu(bdt)\\({}_{2}\\) and Cu(bds)\\({}_{2}\\).",

Very recently, Albino et al.[13] pointed to the role of increased excited state SOC in six coordinate complexes relative to vandyl complexes. Furthermore, Fataftah et al.[33] compared six coordinate V(IV) complexes to Cu(II) complexes to suggest the role of increased covalency in elongating \\(T_{I}\\) relaxation lifetimes.

Furthermore, the totally symmetric stretches of these complexes were computed at 351.7 and 209.8 cm-1, respectively.

The linear coupling terms for V(bds)\\({}_{6}\\) in the g\\({}_{\\parallel}\\) and g\\({}_{\\perp}\\) regions are -0.420 and -0.357 g/A, respectively. For comparison, the linear coupling term of the totally symmetric \\(a_{lg}\\) parent mode of Cu(bdt)\\({}_{2}\\) is smaller (0.232 g/A). Also, the calculated vibrational frequency decreases and the linear coupling terms increase going from V(bdt)\\({}_{3}\\) to V(bds)\\({}_{3}\\). Thus, the longer spin-lattice relaxation time at higher temperatures for Cu(bdt)\\({}_{2}\\) vs. V(bdt)\\({}_{3}\\) is not due to differences in ligand-metal covalency, but rather stems from efficient excited state SOC as a result of the relatively low energy ligand field transition energies for V(bdt)\\({}_{3}\\).

When focusing on the lengths of [n]carbholeicenes, it is assumed that the overlap of the n-planes becomes more significant by forming a layered structure; double layered at n = 7 and triple layered at n = 13. In 2015, [16]carbobielcene (A) was synthesized by Murase and Fujita, and this is the longest [n]carbobielcene ever synthesized (Figure 1).[5] The synthesis of longer helicenes has been desired simply as a synthetic challenge and various improved synthetic methods have been devised.[1-6] Helicenes comprising more than triple-layered structures are particularly difficult to synthesize, because of solubility issues, and because the middle-layered core is tightly compressed, making it difficult to release the strain. Recently, several longer helicene analogues that can release the strain by virtue of their structure have been developed. For example, expanded helicenes, in which phenanthrene units are partially replaced by anthracine units to increase the diameter of helicenes,[6] and perylene bisimide-incorporated helicenes (helicene nanoribbons) have been synthesized.[7] These \"diameter-expanded\" helicene analogues display interesting dynamic behavior and chiroptical properties. Tilly's group synthesized expanded [n]helicenes (B) with three different lengths (n = 15, 19, 23), and compared the racemization barriers and dissymmetry factors.[8] By contrast, Hirose and Matsuda have reported \"n-extended\" [n]carbobielcenes (C) with three different lengths (n = 5, 7, 9), and compared their chiroptical properties, aromaticity, and ultrafast dynamics in the excited state.[9] As another type of helicene analog, heterobielcenes, in which heteroatoms are embedded into the helicene backbones, have also attracted attention because of their excellent luminescence and redox properties.[10; 11] Generally, heterohelicenes are more electron-rich compared with carbobielcenes, thus their HOMO energy levels are continuously destabilized with the n-extension. Therefore, it is more difficult to synthesize longer heterohelicenes with full conjugation, whereas several heterohelicenes with a double-layered structure have been synthesized; one example is diazatri-oxa-[13]helicene D.[12] Furthermore, a triple-layered structure was accomplished with oxa[n]helicene E (n = 17, 19) albeit with disrupted n-conjugation.[13] To qualitatively evaluate the electronic properties of helicenes, however, it is necessary to systematically synthesize fully conjugated heterohelicenes of different lengths, therefore, a synthetic strategy toward longer heterohelicene would be indispensable.

By contrast, for [11]AH, the longest and shortest vertical distances are 3.567 A and 3.202 A, respectively, suggesting a distinct interlayer \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interaction between the stacked aromatic rings. The interplanar angles are 16.3\\({}^{\\circ}\\), 11.6\\({}^{\\circ}\\), and 20.4\\({}^{\\circ}\\), being smaller than that of [9]AH in accordance with the effective interlayer \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions. The crystal structures of [13]AH and [15]AH are also shown in Figure 2A. As the space group is _P3\\({}_{2}\\)_ for the former and the lattice contains only one enantiomer, spontaneous chiral resolution took place for [13]AH upon crystallization. Chiral separation using HPLC apparatus is discussed later. In [13]AH and [15]AH, the shortest interplanar distances are less than 3.2 A (3.199 A and 3.176 A), and the aromatic rings are very closely packed together, again confirming the existence of effective \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions. The smallest interplanar angles are 3.3\\({}^{\\circ}\\) and 1.4\\({}^{\\circ}\\) for [13]AH and [15]AH, respectively. These values are even smaller than those of [11]AH. The crystal structures of [17]AH and [19]AH are the first examples of triple-layered fully conjugated heterobilenes. In both [17]AH and [19]AH, the shortest interplanar distances are also less than 3.2 A (3.170 A and 3.185 A, respectively), and the smallest interplanar angles are the smallest of those measured (1.2\\({}^{\\circ}\\) and 0.8\\({}^{\\circ}\\)). The interplanar angles at the ends are larger than those of the helicene central core due to the effect of electron repulsion and smaller steric constraints ([19]AH; \\(\\theta_{\\rm{A}}\\) = 19.5\\({}^{\\circ}\\), \\(\\theta_{\\rm{BN}}\\) = 0.81\\({}^{\\circ}\\)). However, at the center of the helicene core, the angles are almost 0\\({}^{\\circ}\\), because the central layers of [17]AH and [19]AH are located under large steric constraints from the top and bottom layers. After six types of crystal structures were obtained, their structural parameters of them (interplanar distance, interplanar angle, and dihedral angle) were compared with those of the obtained structures calculated at the B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-SVP level (Fig 2B).[21, 22] For all the parameters, the trend of the experimentally determined values agreed with those obtained from the theoretical calculations, which reproduced the notable changes from [9]AH to [11]AH. This result reflects the weak intramolecular \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions at the terminal aromatic ring of helicenes. A decrease in the interplanar distances or angles results in an increase in the dihedral angles, indicating that the intramolecular interactions become stronger and the aromatic rings become more densely stacked with helicene elongation, while the strain energies of the [n]AHs increase with helicene elongation. To estimate the inherent strain energy of [n]AHs, we attempted to adopt a homodesmotic reaction model.[23] Accordingly, the strain energy (_AH_) of [n]AHs increased continuously as the number _n'_ increased (Figure S7-12). These estimations are in accordance with several cases of expanded helicenes previously reported.[60] Finally, the interlayer \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions of [n]AHs between the two neighboring layers were visualized using the noncovalent interaction (NCI) plot analysis (Figures 2A and S7-11).[24] Dispersion interactions between the two stacked layers of [n]AHs are obvious (green surface shows intramolecular \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions). In particular, intramolecular \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions across three layers was confirmed for [17]AH and [19]AH.",

The longer [n]AHs exhibited negative potentials at -0.06 V for [11]AH, -0.16 V for [13]AH, -0.26 V for [15]AH, -0.38 V for [17]AH, and -0.48 V for [19]AH. The negative shift in the first oxidation potentials can be attributed to an increase in the number of electron-rich pyrrole units in the helicene core.

Nevertheless, the as-synthesized [19]AH was purified using flash chromatography on silica at room temperature and recrystallized from THF/_n_-hexane, allowing the growth of single crystals under ambient conditions (_vide supra_). Molecular orbital calculations were performed for the optimized structures of [n]AH in the ground state (Figure 4). The HOMO energy level gradually increased as the helical length increased. By contrast, the LUMO energy level was not markedly affected by the elongation, resulting in a gradual decrease in the HOMO-LUMO gaps. To gain further insight into the structure-property relationship in these benzannulated aza[n] helicenes without benzannulated structures (_i.e._, [n]AH) were also calculated (Figure S7-8).[25] The HOMO energy levels of [n]AH's are generally higher than those of [n]AHs by 0.11-0.37 eV (_e.g._ -4.45 V for [19]AH vs -4.18 V for [19]AH).
