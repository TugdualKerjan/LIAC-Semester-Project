        "article": "# Anchoring Phenomena in Confined Nematic Liquid Crystals: Applications and Basic Understanding\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe interest in anchoring effects and confined nematic liquid crystals, particularly in the context of liquid crystal display (LCD) devices, has largely been driven by their potential technological applications. The Twisted Nematic Liquid Crystal Cell serves as a prominent example, demonstrating how external fields can manipulate the director orientation.\n\n## Twisted Nematic Cell: An Example of Confined Nematics\n\nA Twisted Nematic Liquid Crystal Cell consists of a nematic liquid crystal sandwiched between two parallel, planar surfaces with perpendicular easy axes. External electric or magnetic fields are used to align the nematic director, resulting in precise control over the surface texture necessary for LCD functionality.\n\n## Non-Uniformity at the Surface\n\nWhen nematic liquid crystals interact with non-uniform substrates, like those created through surface treatments like rubbing, the surface texture is non-uniform. However, this non-uniformity decays rapidly, typically over a length scale proportional to the substrate's periodicity. In many cases, the thickness of the non-uniform layer is much smaller than the wavelengths of visible light and the cell thickness.\n\n## Optical Properties and Effective Substrates\n\nDue to the thinness of the non-uniform layer, the optical properties of the confined liquid crystal are effectively described by uniform substrates. This allows for the development of new electro-optical devices, such as those with patterned nematic directors on small areas, achieved through surface chemistry.\n\n## Nematic-Substrate Interactions and Phase Transitions\n\nNematic liquid crystals in contact with non-uniform substrates offer unique opportunities to study phenomena like effective elastic forces and phase transitions between competing textures. While theoretical calculations can predict some properties, the complex nature of patterned substrates presents numerical challenges.\n\n## Continuum Theory for Nematic Liquid Crystals\n\nContinuum theories, rooted in Oseen and Zocher's work, form the basis for understanding nematic liquid crystals. The Frank theory, which describes the director and its distortions, assumes a uniform equilibrium state with a free-energy cost associated with elastic distortions. The presence of surfaces introduces surface anchoring and modifies the free energy density.\n\n## Effective Free Energy Function for Patterned Substrates\n\nTo address the complexities introduced by patterned substrates, an effective free energy function is derived, incorporating the anchoring energy and the average surface director orientation. This function allows for a more accurate prediction of phase diagrams compared to direct minimization of the original free energy functional.\n\n## Numerical Challenges and the Effective Free Energy Method\n\nMinimizing the original free energy functional on a two-dimensional grid can be computationally demanding, especially for large cell widths and complex surface patterns. The effective free energy method, by mapping the functional to one with an average surface director, simplifies the calculation and provides more reliable predictions for arbitrary cell widths and anchoring angles.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnderstanding anchoring phenomena in confined nematic liquid crystals is crucial for the development of advanced liquid crystal technologies. By employing effective free energy functions and numerical methods, researchers can study the intricate interactions between the liquid crystals and patterned substrates, contributing to the design of novel devices with improved performance.",

        "article": "# Quantum Correlations in Optical Systems: An Overview\n\n## Introduction\n\nQuantum correlations, particularly those in continuous variables, form the backbone of emerging technologies like quantum information and computation, quantum cryptography, and quantum-enhanced metrology. These correlations are exhibited in various aspects, including spatial degrees of freedom, temporal separations, and optical systems in the multi-photon regime. The optical parametric oscillator (OPO), a device that converts a classical input beam into multiple photons, plays a significant role in generating squeezing and entanglement in continuous-variable fields.\n\n### Continuous Variables and Optical Parametric Oscillators\n\nIn OPOs, the nonlinearity of the quadratic crystal allows for interactions between light modes, resulting in squeezing and entanglement in field quadratures. Different modes can be distinguished by their polarization or frequency, enabling applications like optical switching, quantum imaging, and metrology.\n\n### Spatial Quantum Correlations\n\nRecent interest lies in spatial degrees of freedom, where quantum correlations are observed between cavity modes or parts of light beams. This has led to practical applications, such as multimode light-based technologies, which demonstrate features like quantum entanglement and squeezing.\n\n### Photonic Band-Gap Engineering\n\nPhotonic crystals (PCs), engineered media with periodic modulation of the refractive index, confine and guide light, providing a platform for controlling quantum properties. In nonlinear cavities with transverse modulation, the predicted inhibition of modulation instabilities has been experimentally confirmed, opening up new possibilities in quantum optics.\n\n### Modulation in Dissipative Systems\n\nModulation in dissipative systems can lead to the formation of nonlinear structures like discrete cavity solitons. PCs are also employed in proposals for quantum optics, such as inhibiting spontaneous emission in photonic band-gaps and engineering the environment for cavity QED.\n\n## Model of a PC-OPO: Linear and Few-Mode Approximation\n\nTo study the effect of a transversal modulation on quantum fluctuations and correlations in a nonlinear device, we consider a PC-OPO with a linear and few-mode approximation for the light fluctuations below the parametric threshold. The output signal field is expressed in terms of the input field, and a set of nonlinear Langevin equations is derived and numerically simulated to validate the approximations.\n\n## Threshold Analysis: Modulating Instability\n\nAn analytical expression for the signal field intensity is obtained, demonstrating that the instability threshold can be manipulated by the spatial modulation of the PC. This modulation can either raise or lower the threshold.\n\n## Quantum Correlations: Squeezing, Entanglement, and Twin Beams\n\nExpressions for various quantum correlations, such as squeezing, entanglement, and twin beams correlations, are derived, highlighting the tunability of these correlations through the PC.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe study of quantum fluctuations and correlations in a PC-OPO reveals the potential for manipulating these phenomena using spatial modulations.

        "article": "# Methanol Maser Studies: A Comprehensive Overview\n\n## Introduction\n\nMethanol masers, primarily classified into Class I and II, are key diagnostic tools in understanding star formation processes. These transitions are excited differently \u2013 Class I by collisions and Class II through radiative mechanisms. The relationship between the two classes and their respective environments is complex, as they are often found in distinct velocity and spatial configurations.\n\n### Class I and Class II Methanol Masers\n\nClass I masers, such as those at 36 and 44 GHz, are believed to trace earlier stages of star formation, possibly influenced by shocks. Their association with other star formation indicators like water and OH masers suggests a potential evolutionary sequence. However, biases in previous studies might have affected our understanding of their evolutionary timeline.\n\n### Spatial and Velocity Overlap\n\nClass I and Class II masers are rarely seen coexisting at the same velocity or in close proximity. The lack of simultaneous spatial resolution in previous observations hampers the precise study of their relationships.\n\n### Complex Environments and High Angular Resolution\n\nThe clustered nature of star formation requires high angular resolution to resolve the connections between masers and their excitation sources, as well as to analyze multiple methanol transitions.\n\n## Recent Observations and Upgrades\n\nRecent advancements in telescope technology, particularly the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA), have allowed for the first arcsecond-resolution imaging of 36 GHz methanol masers in the DR21 star-forming complex. These observations provide crucial insights into the distribution and properties of the masers.\n\n### DR21 Star-Forming Complex\n\nObservations were conducted in May 2010 using the EVLA, targeting the 36.169 GHz methanol line in DR21(Oh), DR21W, and DR21N. The array had 20 telescopes equipped with Ka-band receivers, and the data were correlated with the WIDAR correlator.\n\n### Data Analysis and Results\n\nA total of 49 36 GHz maser features were detected, distributed across the three sources. Individual maser spectra often showed non-Gaussian shapes, indicating the presence of sub-beam structures. Some masers exhibited multiple spectral peaks or skewness, suggesting small-scale structures not resolved by the synthesized beam.\n\n### Interferometric Comparison\n\nComparison with other Class I transitions, 44 GHz, 84 GHz, and 95 GHz, revealed similarities in linewidths and hints of extended emission. The flux density ratios between different transitions in close spatial association remain to be studied further.\n\n### Velocity Overlaps and Brightness Differences\n\n14 overlapping maser features were identified, with 7 showing brighter 36 GHz emission and 7 having brighter 229 GHz counterparts, hinting at variability or different brightness states.\n\n### Future Directions\n\nThese findings motivate further high-resolution observations to investigate the evolutionary links between different maser transitions and their spatial associations. Additional data will help refine our understanding of the complex star-forming environments.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMethanol masers, despite their importance in star formation research, remain an intriguing subject due to their diverse nature and complex relationships. The recent EVLA observations provide valuable insights, but more work is needed to fully unravel the evolutionary picture of these masers in clustered environments.",

This network captures the multidisciplinary nature of research outputs and their influence.\n\n### Network Representation and Adjacency Tensors\nThe multilayer adjacency tensor is defined with four components to represent citations within and across disciplines. It encodes information about the intensity of relationships and the discipline-specific nature of the citations.\n\n### Ranking Publications and Producers\nThe pagerank, a concept borrowed from Google's web ranking algorithm, is applied to the interconnected multilayer network to rank publications and their producers based on their scientific impact and versatility. This measures the connectivity and influence across disciplines.\n\n### Case Studies: APS and US Patents Datasets\nTwo real-world datasets are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method: the American Physical Society (APS) papers and the US patents. These datasets highlight the applicability of the methodology to various scientific fields.\n\n## Conclusion\nIncorporating interdisciplinarity into the evaluation of research and its producers is crucial for fostering innovation and advancing knowledge.

        "article": "# Introduction to Spinfoams in Loop Quantum Gravity\n\n## Overview of Spinfoams and Their Role in LQG\n\nSpinfoams are a key aspect of Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG), providing a covariant formulation for the dynamics of the theory. They describe the evolution of states within the kinematical Hilbert space of LQG using transition amplitudes, which are functions of spins and intertwiners associated with spin networks.\n\n### Spin-Network Basis and Transition Amplitudes\n\nIn the context of spin networks, the transition amplitude is calculated using a basis of interconnected links and nodes, where the amplitude is determined by the spins and intertwiners assigned to these structures. The most recent literature discusses spinfoams in terms of these variables, representing a space-time configuration as a complex with faces labeled by spins and edges labeled by intertwiners.\n\n## Representations of the LQG Hilbert Space in Spinfoams\n\nTwo main representations are considered in this paper: the **holonomy representation** and the **holomorphic representation**. The holonomy representation relates spinfoams to a Feynman-like path integral, involving Ashtekar's connection smeared along links. The holomorphic representation, inspired by Segal-Bargmann transform, is built on the work of Ashtekar et al. and provides a new perspective on the semiclassical behavior of spinfoams.\n\n### Holonomy Representation\n\nIn the holonomy representation, spinfoams are written as integrals over Ashtekar's connection, with each link's holonomy being the configuration variable. This representation allows for a closer connection to the path integral formalism.\n\n### Holomorphic Representation\n\nThe holomorphic representation, on the other hand, uses the Segal-Bargmann transform to represent the holonomies in terms of complex variables. It is particularly useful in understanding the semiclassical limit and is associated with coherent spin-network states that are peaked on classical geometries.\n\n### Connection to Coherent Spin-Networks\n\nCoherent spin-networks, with their peaked properties, play a crucial role in the holomorphic representation. These states provide an overcomplete basis for the boundary Hilbert space and can be used to analyze the large-scale asymptotics of spinfoam vertices.\n\n## Euclidean and Lorentzian Spinfoam Vertices\n\nExpressions for both Euclidean and Lorentzian spinfoam vertices are derived in both the holonomy and holomorphic representations. The peaked nature of coherent spin-networks is leveraged to select a unique classical solution in the Lorentzian case, addressing the presence of an unwanted classical solution in the semiclassical expansion.\n\n## Boundary Averages and Local Structure\n\nBoundary amplitudes are also discussed, with spinfoam vertices being local in spacetime, represented as a product of elementary vertex-amplitudes integrated over bulk variables. This local structure is essential for the composition law of spinfoam amplitudes.\n\n### Spin-And-Intertwiner and Spin-And-Normals Representations\n\nThe paper compares the holonomy representation with the more common \"spin and intertwiner\" representation, which is related via the Peter-Weyl transform. The \"spin and normals\" representation, involving coherent intertwiners, is shown to be particularly useful in the semiclassical analysis due to its classical nature.\n\n## Conclusion and Future Directions\n\nIn conclusion, this paper introduces and explores the use of coherent spin-networks and their associated holomorphic representation in spinfoam calculations. The new representation offers insights into the classical limit and computational advantages, potentially leading to a deeper understanding of the dynamics in LQG. Further research may focus on refining these techniques and applying them to more complex geometries and physical scenarios.",

        "abstract": " in this paper , we study a two - lane totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) coupled with random attachment and detachment of particles ( langmuir kinetics ) in both lanes under open boundary conditions . \n our model can describe the directed motion of molecular motors , attachment and detachment of motors , and free inter - lane transition of motors between filaments . in this paper \n , we focus on some finite - size effects of the system because normally the sizes of most real systems are finite and small ( e.g. , size @xmath0 ) . \n a special finite - size effect of the two - lane system has been observed , which is that the density wall moves left first and then move towards the right with the increase of the lane - changing rate . \n we called it the jumping effect . \n we find that increasing attachment and detachment rates will weaken the jumping effect . \n we also confirmed that when the size of the two - lane system is large enough , the jumping effect disappears , and the two - lane system has a similar density profile to a single - lane tasep coupled with langmuir kinetics . \n increasing lane - changing rates has little effect on density and current after the density reaches maximum . also , lane - changing rate has no effect on density profiles of a two - lane tasep coupled with langmuir kinetics at a large attachment / detachment rate and/or a large system size . \n mean - field approximation is presented and it agrees with our monte carlo simulations .

        "abstract": " we consider evaluation of matrix elements with the coupled - cluster method . \n such calculations formally involve infinite number of terms and we devise a method of partial summation ( dressing ) of the resulting series . \n our formalism is built upon an expansion of the product @xmath0 of cluster amplitudes @xmath1 into a sum of @xmath2-body insertions . \n we consider two types of insertions : particle / hole line insertion and two - particle / two - hole random - phase - approximation - like insertion . \n we demonstrate how to `` dress '' these insertions and formulate iterative equations . \n we illustrate the dressing equations in the case when the cluster operator is truncated at single and double excitations . using univalent systems as an example , we upgrade coupled - cluster diagrams for matrix elements with the dressed insertions and highlight a relation to pertinent fourth - order diagrams . \n we illustrate our formalism with relativistic calculations of hyperfine constant @xmath3 and @xmath4 electric - dipole transition amplitude for cs atom . finally , we augment the truncated coupled - cluster calculations with otherwise omitted fourth - order diagrams . \n the resulting analysis for cs is complete through the fourth - order of many - body perturbation theory and reveals an important role of triple and disconnected quadruple excitations .
