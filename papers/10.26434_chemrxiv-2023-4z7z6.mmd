###### Abstract

Synthetic challenges toward anomalous structures and electronic states often involve handling problems such as insolubility in common organic solvents and oxidative degradation under aerobic conditions. We designed benzo-annulated aza[n]helicenes, which benefit from both the suppressed elevation of HOMO energies and high solubility due to hydrogen-bonding with solvent molecules to overcome these challenges. This strategy enabled the synthesis of six new aza[n]helicenes ([n]AHs) of different lengths (n = 9-19) from acyclic precursors via one-shot oxidative fusion reactions. The structures of all the synthesized aza[n]helicenes were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, and their electrochemical potentials were measured by cyclic voltammetry. Among the synthesized aza[n]helicenes, [17]**AH** and [19]**AH** are the first hetero-helicenes with a triple-layered helix. The noncovalent interaction (NCI) plots confirm the existence of an effective n-n interaction between the layers. The absorption and fluorescence spectra red-shifted as the helical lengths increased, without any distinct saturation points. The optical resolutions of _N_-butylated **[9]**AH**, and **[11]**AH** were accomplished and their circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) were measured. Thus, the structural, (chir)optical, and electrochemical properties of the aza[n]helicenes were comprehensively analyzed.

## Introduction

Helicene is a class of chiral n-conjugated molecules with a screw-shaped skeleton formed by _ortho_-fused benzene rings (_i.e._, phenanthrene units) that has been actively studied.[1] In addition to the chiroptical properties such as circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL),[2] their physical properties as molecular springs[3] and the CISS effect[4] are cutting-edge functionalities based on the helical molecular scaffold. When focusing on the lengths of [n]carbholeicenes, it is assumed that the overlap of the n-planes becomes more significant by forming a layered structure; double layered at n = 7 and triple layered at n = 13. In 2015, [16]carbobielcene **(A)** was synthesized by Murase and Fujita, and this is the longest [n]carbobielcene ever synthesized (Figure 1).[5] The synthesis of longer helicenes has been desired simply as a synthetic challenge and various improved synthetic methods have been devised.[1-6] Helicenes comprising more than triple-layered structures are particularly difficult to synthesize, because of solubility issues, and because the middle-layered core is tightly compressed, making it difficult to release the strain. Recently, several longer helicene analogues that can release the strain by virtue of their structure have been developed. For example, expanded helicenes, in which phenanthrene units are partially replaced by anthracine units to increase the diameter of helicenes,[6] and perylene bisimide-incorporated helicenes (helicene nanoribbons) have been synthesized.[7] These "diameter-expanded" helicene analogues display interesting dynamic behavior and chiroptical properties. Tilly's group synthesized expanded [n]helicenes **(B)** with three different lengths (n = 15, 19, 23), and compared the racemization barriers and dissymmetry factors.[8] By contrast, Hirose and Matsuda have reported "n-extended" [n]carbobielcenes **(C)** with three different lengths (n = 5, 7, 9), and compared their chiroptical properties, aromaticity, and ultrafast dynamics in the excited state.[9] As another type of helicene analog, heterobielcenes, in which heteroatoms are embedded into the helicene backbones, have also attracted attention because of their excellent luminescence and redox properties.[10; 11] Generally, heterohelicenes are more electron-rich compared with carbobielcenes, thus their HOMO energy levels are continuously destabilized with the n-extension. Therefore, it is more difficult to synthesize longer heterohelicenes with full conjugation, whereas several heterohelicenes with a double-layered structure have been synthesized; one example is diazatri-oxa-[13]helicene **D**.[12] Furthermore, a triple-layered structure was accomplished with oxa[n]helicene **E** (n = 17, 19) albeit with disrupted n-conjugation.[13] To qualitatively evaluate the electronic properties of helicenes, however, it is necessary to systematically synthesize fully conjugated heterohelicenes of different lengths, therefore, a synthetic strategy toward longer heterohelicene would be indispensable. Currently, few systematic synthetic methods are available for the synthesis of heterohelicenes.

We recently reported one-shot oxidative fusion reactions of _ortho_-phenylene-bridged oligopyrcles to afford various heterocirculenes and heterohelicenes.[14; 15] Notably, tetrazza[8]circulenes, with planar structures excluding any sterically encumbering substituents, are fairly soluble in THF and DMSO.[16] This property arises from effective hydrogen-bonding interactions between the pyrrol NH site and the H-bond accepting solvent molecule. Inspired by this molecular design principle, we report a synthetic challenge for longer azahelicenes with outer-pointing pyrrolic NH sites. By exploiting the one-shot oxidative fusion reactions of suitably designed indole-terminated acyclic oligopyrroles (_wide infra_), a series of benzannulated aza[n]helicenes were obtained. This structure is suitable for suppressing the elevation of the HOMO energy levels by virtue of Clar's sextet rule.[17] In other words, the designed benzannulated aza[1]helicenes are an ideal platform to accomplish longer fully conjugated hetero[n]helicenes with respect to solubility and stability issues. Comprehensive characterizations by NMR, UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy, electrochemistry, as well as CD and CPL spectra of the enantiomers revealed the \(\pi\)-conjugation along the helix and between the layers.

## Results and Discussion

**Synthesis of aza[n]helicenes.** In our previous study on the synthesis of dibenzoaz[7]helicenes, acyclic precursors like \(\mathbf{6_{7}}\) were effectively utilized.[19] In this study, the extended analogs \(\mathbf{6_{n}}\) and \(\mathbf{8_{n}}\) were synthesized using Pd-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions, followed by oxidation with [bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo]benzene (PIFA) to afford a series of benzannulated aza[n]helicenes (hereafter referred to as **[n]AH**) (n = 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19). In the case of aza[n]helicenes with n = 9, 13, 17, aryl bromides \(\mathbf{3_{m}}\) were synthesized by Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions of excess amounts of 1-bromo-2-iodobenzene or aryl dibromide \(\mathbf{1_{m}}\) with \(\alpha\)-borylated indole **2** (Scheme 1). Next, aryl boronic acid pinced esters \(\mathbf{4_{m}}\)-**Bpin** were synthesized via cross-coupling reactions of 3**m with \(\alpha\)-borylated pyrrole and subsequent Ir-catalyzed borolvation. Dipyrrole chloride \(\mathbf{5^{15}}\) was coupled with a small excess of \(\mathbf{4_{m}}\)-**Bpin** in the presence of 5.0 mol% XYhos Pd G2 and excess potassium carbonate in THF/H\({}_{2}\)O to afford the acyclic precursors \(\mathbf{6_{n}}\). Finally, oxidative fusion reactions of the acyclic precursors with PIFA at low temperatures afforded the corresponding **[n]AHs**. For **[n]AHs** with n = 11, 15, 19, aryl bromides \(\mathbf{3_{m}}\) were used as coupling partners. Tripyrrole diboronic acid pinacol ester \(\mathbf{7^{15}}\) was coupled with a small excess of the synthesized aryl bromides \(\mathbf{3_{m}}\) in the presence of 5.0 mol% XYhos Pd G2 and an excess of potassium carbonate in THF/H\({}_{2}\)O at room temperature to afford acyclic precursors \(\mathbf{8_{m}}\) although the yields were moderate probably because of the competing protodeboronation reactions. Similarly, the oxidative fusion of acyclic precursors \(\mathbf{8_{n}}\) by PIFA afforded **[n]AHs**. All six **[n]AHs** were purified using silica-gel column chromatography and recrystallization from THF/_n_-hexane in open air. All **[n]AHs** were characterized by 'H- and '\({}^{3}\)C-NMR, and HR-MS (See the Supporting Information, SI). 'H-NMR spectra of the obtained **[n]AHs** were measured in DMSO-\(d_{6}\) at room temperature with one drop of hydrazine monohydrate to prevent the generation of oxidized species.[19] For all **[n]AHs**, NMR spectra reflecting the \(C_{2}\)-symmetric structures were obtained. The terminal benzene protons (_indole-H_) shifted considerably upfield, indicating that these aromatic protons were located above other aromatic rings. Notably, upfield shifts in the signals in the aromatic region were observed as the helical length increased, probably because of the enhancement of anisotropic shielding by the \(\pi\)-electron of the stacked aromatic rings (Figure S3-45).

**X-ray crystal structures**. Fortunately, single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis were obtained by slow vapor diffusion of _n_-hexane into solutions of **[n]AHs** in THF, acetone, or 1,4-dioxane. The structures are shown in Figure 2A in which the solvent molecules coordinated to the NH moiety via hydrogen bonds are omitted. Because of the sophisticated molecular design, intermolecular interactions between **[n]AHs** were not observed in any of the structures, thereby contributing good solubility. Indeed, five and seven acetone molecules were included in the asymmetric units of **[13]AH** and **[15]AH**, respectively, (Figures S5-4, 5-5) whereas seven 1,4-dioxane molecules were included in the asymmetric unit of **[19]AH** (Figure S5-7). For **[9]AH**, the vertical distance (interplanar distance) between the centroid of terminal benzene ring A and the mean plain of the opposite terminal benzene ring I is 3.807 A. As the typical distance of \(\pi\)-stacking is approximately 3.4 A, interlayer interaction between the terminal benzene rings may be minimal, similarly to that of [7]carbobilecene (3.8-3.9 A).[20] The interplanar angle between the stacked two benzene rings is approximately 40\({}^{\circ}\), which also suggests that the interlayer \(\pi\)-\(\pi\) interaction is weak. By contrast, for **[11]AH**, the longest and shortest vertical distances are 3.567 A and 3.202 A, respectively, suggesting a distinct interlayer \(\pi\)-\(\pi\) interaction between the stacked aromatic rings. The interplanar angles are 16.3\({}^{\circ}\), 11.6\({}^{\circ}\), and 20.4\({}^{\circ}\), being smaller than that of **[9]AH** in accordance with the effective interlayer \(\pi\)-\(\pi\) interactions. The crystal structures of **[13]AH** and **[15]AH** are also shown in Figure 2A. As the space group is _P3\({}_{2}\)_ for the former and the lattice contains only one enantiomer, spontaneous chiral resolution took place for **[13]AH** upon crystallization. Chiral separation using HPLC apparatus is discussed later. In **[13]AH** and **[15]AH**, the shortest interplanar distances are less than 3.2 A (3.199 A and 3.176 A), and the aromatic rings are very closely packed together, again confirming the existence of effective \(\pi\)-\(\pi\) interactions. The smallest interplanar angles are 3.3\({}^{\circ}\) and 1.4\({}^{\circ}\) for **[13]AH** and **[15]AH**, respectively. These values are even smaller than those of **[11]AH**. The crystal structures of **[17]AH** and **[19]AH** are the first examples of triple-layered fully conjugated heterobilenes. In both **[17]AH** and **[19]AH**, the shortest interplanar distances are also less than 3.2 A (3.170 A and 3.185 A, respectively), and the smallest interplanar angles are the smallest of those measured (1.2\({}^{\circ}\) and 0.8\({}^{\circ}\)). The interplanar angles at the ends are larger than those of the helicene central core due to the effect of electron repulsion and smaller steric constraints **([19]AH; \(\theta_{\rm{A}}\)** = 19.5\({}^{\circ}\), \(\theta_{\rm{BN}}\) = 0.81\({}^{\circ}\))**. However, at the center of the helicene core, the angles are almost 0\({}^{\circ}\), because the central layers of **[17]AH** and **[19]AH** are located under large steric constraints from the top and bottom layers. After six types of crystal structures were obtained, their structural parameters of them (interplanar distance, interplanar angle, and dihedral angle) were compared with those of the obtained structures calculated at the B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-SVP level (Fig 2B).[21, 22] For all the parameters, the trend of the experimentally determined values agreed with those obtained from the theoretical calculations, which reproduced the notable changes from **[9]AH** to **[11]AH**. This result reflects the weak intramolecular \(\pi\)-\(\pi\) interactions at the terminal aromatic ring of helicenes. A decrease in the interplanar distances or angles results in an increase in the dihedral angles, indicating that the intramolecular interactions become stronger and the aromatic rings become more densely stacked with helicene elongation, while the strain energies of the **[n]AHs** increase with helicene elongation. To estimate the inherent strain energy of **[n]AHs**, we attempted to adopt a homodesmotic reaction model.[23] Accordingly, the strain energy (_AH_) of **[n]AHs** increased continuously as the number _n'_ increased (Figure S7-12). These estimations are in accordance with several cases of expanded helicenes previously reported.[60] Finally, the interlayer \(\pi\)-\(\pi\) interactions of **[n]AHs** between the two neighboring layers were visualized using the noncovalent interaction (NCI) plot analysis (Figures 2A and S7-11).[24] Dispersion interactions between the two stacked layers of **[n]AHs** are obvious (green surface shows intramolecular \(\pi\)-\(\pi\) interactions). In particular, intramolecular \(\pi\)-\(\pi\) interactions across three layers was confirmed for **[17]AH** and **[19]AH**.

**Electrochemical properties.** The electrochemical properties of **[n]AHs** were measured using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in THF (Figure 3). All the **[n]AHs** exhibited reversible first oxidative waves, and the half-wave potential of **[9]AH** was recorded at +0.09 V against the ferrocene/ferrocenium ion couple. The longer **[n]AHs** exhibited negative potentials at -0.06 V for **[11]AH**, -0.16 V for **[13]AH**, -0.26 V for **[15]AH**, -0.38 V for **[17]AH**, and -0.48 V for **[19]AH**. The negative shift in the first oxidation potentials can be attributed to an increase in the number of electron-rich pyrrole units in the helicene core. In particular, **[19]AH** was confirmed to be very easily oxidized. Nevertheless, the as-synthesized **[19]AH** was purified using flash chromatography on silica at room temperature and recrystallized from THF/_n_-hexane, allowing the growth of single crystals under ambient conditions (_vide supra_). Molecular orbital calculations were performed for the optimized structures of **[n]AH** in the ground state (Figure 4). The HOMO energy level gradually increased as the helical length increased. By contrast, the LUMO energy level was not markedly affected by the elongation, resulting in a gradual decrease in the HOMO-LUMO gaps. To gain further insight into the structure-property relationship in these benzannulated aza[n] helicenes without benzannulated structures (_i.e._, **[n]AH**) were also calculated (Figure S7-8).[25] The HOMO energy levels of **[n]AH**'s are generally higher than those of **[n]AHs** by 0.11-0.37 eV (_e.g._ -4.45 V for **[19]AH** vs -4.18 V for **[19]AH**). Therefore, as a proof-of-concept, the benzannulated molecular design principle contributes to the stabilization of the longer aza[n] helicenes.

**Aromaticity.** To evaluate the aromaticity of **[n]AHs**, the NICS(0) value at the center of each rings was calculated using the GIAO method at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level based on the optimized structures [26]. The NICS(0) values of **[9]A**H and **[11]AH** are in the range from -6.6 to -11.6 ppm and from -6.3 to -12.3 ppm, respectively (Figure 5A). Rings 3 and 5 were relatively shielded whereas the local aromaticity in the pyrrole units (Rings 2, 4, (6)) and the terminal benzene moiety (ring 1) were dominant. The HOMA values are consistent with the local aromaticity of these rings [27]. Notably, the benzo segments (rings 6 and 7 for **[9]AH** and rings 7 and 8 for **[11]AH**) exhibit relatively deshielded features compared with the neighboring six-membered ring. The anisotropy of the induced current density (ACID) calculations [20] revealed the localized aromatic ring-current flows of the pyrrole and the annulated benzene rings in **[9]AH** and **[11]AH** as the dominant contributions (Figure 4B). These results represented Clar's sextet rule as shown in Figure 4C. Such local aromaticity suppresses the increase in the HOMO energy levels to the extent that the isolation of these molecules without any kinetically stabilizing substituents is allowed under air. The same calculations were performed for longer **[n]AH** and the same trend in their aromaticity was observed (Figures S7-9, S7-10).

(solvent: THF, electrolyte:(Chir)optical properties.The UV/vis absorption and fluorescence spectra of a series of aza[n]helicenes were measured in THF at room temperature (Figures 6A and 6B). The edges of the absorption spectra are red-shifted, and the molar extinction coefficient (\(\varepsilon\)) increases with helicase \(\pi\)-extension. In particular, the absorption spectral edge of the longest **[19]AH** reaches approximately 500 nm, suggesting that the effective conjugation length (ECL) in this system was not saturated.[29] This result was supported by the HOMO-LUMO energy gaps obtained from theoretical calculations (Figure 57-7). All the aza[n]helicenes exhibited blue-to-yellow luminescence with some vibrational bands. The edges of the fluorescence spectra also show gradual red-shifts along with the helicase \(\pi\)-extension. The absolute fluorescence quantum yields (\(\Phi_{\mathrm{F}}\)) tended to decrease with increasing helical length (_e.g._\(\Phi_{\mathrm{F}}\) = 0.21 for **[9]AH** and \(\phi_{\mathrm{F}}\) = 0.08 for **[19]AH**) (Figure 6C). However, even **[19]AH** exhibits distinct blue-green fluorescence with \(\Phi_{\mathrm{F}}\) = 0.08 as a characteristic feature of heterobilecenes. By contrast, **[17]AH** exhibits a high fluorescence quantum yield with \(\Phi_{\mathrm{F}}\) = 0.18, which may be attributed to its rigid structure and suppressed nonradiative deactivation as a result of the large steric constraints caused by the triple-layered structure.

## Conclusions

In conclusion, six new aza[n]helicenes [**[n]AH]** of different lengths (n = 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19) were successfully synthesized from acyclic precursors via one-shot oxidative fusion reactions with PIFA. The structures of all synthesized azah helicenes were determined using XRD analysis. [**17]AH** and [**19]AH** are the first heteropticleines with a triple-layered helix. The structural parameters of the helicenes (_i.e._, interplanar distance, interplanar angle, and torsion angle) were compared experimentally and theoretically. The intramolecular interactions became stronger and the aromatic rings became more densely stacked with the elongation of the helical structure. The NCI plots confirmed the existence of an effective \(\pi\)-\(\pi\) interaction between the layers. Electrochemical potentials were measured using CV, and the first oxidation potential shifted to the negative side in response to helicene elongation. The absorption and fluorescence spectra red-shifted as the helical lengths increased, without any distinct saturation points. The optical resolutions of _N_-butylated [**9]AH** and [**11]AH were accomplished, and their CD and CPL spectra were measured. The molecular design of the azah helicenes synthesized in this study solves the stability and solubility problems encountered thus far, and may provide an ideal platform for the synthesis of longer heterobilecenes.
