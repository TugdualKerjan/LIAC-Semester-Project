Dynamic covalent gels have been synthesized from an aromatic trialdehyde and \(\alpha\),\(\omega\)-dinitroalkanes via the nitroaldol reaction in organic solvents. The gelation process could be finetuned by changing the starting nitroalkanes, solvents, feed concentration, catalyst loading, or reaction temperature. The resulting organogels demonstrated good structural integrity and excellent self-healing ability. Intact xerogels were produced upon drying, without damaging the network, and the solvent-free network could recover its gel form in the presence of an organic solvent. Furthermore, the crosslinked dynameric gel depolymerized to small molecules in response to excess nitromethane.

## Introduction

The application of dynamic covalent chemistry into the field of polymer science has given rise to fascinating dynamic covalent polymers (dynamers) with emergent properties [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Equipped with reversible covalent linkages, dynamers can undergo bond exchange and constitutional, structural rearrangement, thus leading to a wide spectrum of properties, such as stimuli-responsiveness, self-healing ability, shape-memory behavior, degradability and recyclability, antimicrobial and wound-dressing abilities, etc. [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32]. Due to the large scope of available dynamic building blocks and the versatility of reversible covalent reactions, dynamers of a wide diversity of topologies, _e.g._ linear structures [1, 5, 33, 34], amorphous networks [35, 2, 36, 37, 34], and dynamic covalent frameworks [38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43], have been discovered in the past decades.

One of the major polymeric architectures, polymer networks, can be generated through crosslinking of polymer chains or through the reaction of multifunctional monomers. The resulting network formation brings about robustness and stability to the material [44, 45, 46]. However, due to the permanent nature of the irreversible covalent linkages, many conventional network polymers, especially thermosets, are fixed in structure and typically not easily repairable or recyclable, causing many environmental problems [47, 48]. Fortunately, crosslinked dynamers, also referred to as covalent adaptable networks or vitrimers, have been developed by replacing covalent bonds with dynamic counterparts, therefore allowing constitutional structural adjustments in the polymer matrices [37, 49, 50, 51, 52]. Thanks to this, network dynamers can be easilyreprogrammed and recycled through reversible reactions, such as imine and hydrazome formation and exchange [19, 24, 53, 54]. Diels-Alder reaction [55, 56, 57, 58, 59], boronate formation [6, 61, 60, 61], transesterification [47, 50, 62, 63], and other transformations [20, 23, 36, 64, 65].

Our previous studies have revealed the high efficiency of the nitroaldol (Henry) reaction in generating linear dynamers with reversible C-C bonds [1, 5]. These polymers have demonstrated excellent dynamicity and intricate topological changes in response to the applied conditions. However, the application of the nitroaldol reaction in the formation of more complex polymer systems has not been extensively explored. This is, however, of great importance, since this approach would give rise to new types of functional materials based on dynamic and stimuli-responsive C-C bonds, and raises the prospect of addressing challenges of conventional crosslinked polymers [47, 48]. In the present study, we have addressed the feasibility of constructing crosslinked dynamers through the nitroaldol reaction and investigated the properties of the resulting materials. We thus report the crosslinking and gelation of an aromatic trialdehyde with different \(\alpha\),\(\omega\)-dinitroalkanes in organic solvents. The gelation process was examined through chemical and mechanical approaches, and the effects on the gelation were investigated. Moreover, the responsive behavior of the organogels, including self-healing and degradation, are also demonstrated.

## Results and Discussion

In light of the high efficiency and dynamicity of the nitroaldol reaction between formylpyridines and nitroalkanes [1, 5], dynamic crosslinking systems composed of 2,4,6-pyridinetricarboxaldehyde (**1**) and \(\alpha\),\(\omega\)-dinitroalkanes **2a-h** were designed. Thus, the interconnections between tritopic compound **1** and ditopic compounds **2a-h** in a molar ratio of 2:3 would be able to generate dynamic polymers displaying an intricate three-dimensional network topology (**Figure 1a**).

To evaluate the proposed crosslinking reaction, a dual entry-point equilibration study was initially performed on a model system (**Figure 1b**, Figure S1) [1, 66]. The reaction of trialdehyde **1** with monotopic 1-nitro propane (**4**) in deuterated dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO-d\({}_{6}\)) was triggered by adding triethylamine as the catalyst. As shown in the \({}^{1}\)H-NMR spectrum (**Figure 1d**), upon reaching equilibrium, nitroaldol adducts (o) were produced in the presence of small amounts of partially-reacted trialdehyde (\(\bullet\) ), and the starting nitroalkane (\(\bigtriangledown\)). However, no unreacted trialdehyde signals were observed at equilibrium, indicating the high efficiency of the forward nitroaldol reaction in this system. The reverse reaction was then carried out by adding Et\({}_{3}\)N into a DMSO-d\({}_{6}\) solution of trinitroalcohol **5**. At equilibrium, the partial decomposition of compound **5** and the appearance of compound **4**, together with trace amounts of molecular species (\(\bullet\) ) with both nitroalcohol and aldehyde groups on the pyridine ring, reveal the occurrence of the retro-nitroaldol process (**Figure 1e**). By comparison of the \({}^{1}\)H-NMR spectra, the equilibrium compositions of the forward reaction between compounds **1** and **4** and the retro-nitroaldol reaction of compound **5**, were in close agreement. These results demonstrate that the reactions from opposite directions settled into an equilibrium state closer to the trinitroalcohol side than the starting materials side in the model system. This indicates that the proposed nitroaldol crosslinking process could lead to the efficient, while reversible, formation of dynamers.

Network dynamic formation was subsequently addressed, and the reactions of trialdehyde **1** with eight dinitroalkanes **2a-h** in DMSO were investigated (Figure S16, Table S1). Dinitroalkanes with even numbers of carbon atoms displayed better gelation performance than the other four building blocks, which could be reflective of the odd-even alternation patternsin the thermodynamic properties of unbranched alkanes [67, 68, 69, 70].

Twelve organic solvents, in which the starting materials were well soluble, were then screened to find the ideal environment for gelation (Figure S11, Table S2). Stable gelation was observed in five of the tested solvents. Eventually, DMSO was selected as the solvent for all subsequent experiments because of the short gelation time and high gel stability.

\({}^{1}\)H-NMR was next used to monitor the reaction between compounds **1** and **2d** in DMSO-d\({}_{6}\). As can be seen in **Figure 2a**, the reaction started immediately upon addition of triethylamine. Compound **1**, displaying aldehyde signals at 10.25 ppm and 10.15 ppm, was consumed within minutes, while new aldehyde peaks corresponding to di- and monoaldehydes appeared in a more upfield region (9.90-10.12 ppm). All aldehyde peaks disappeared within 30 minutes showing the high reaction conversion. The dinitroalkane \(\alpha\)-proton resonance at 4.53 ppm showed similar changes, gradually decreasing until almost complete disappearance over the experiment time period. Meanwhile, new signals grew in, bearing distinct resemblance, albeit

broadened, to the peaks corresponding to those of the reference nitroalcohol **5** (Figure S4), indicating the formation of nitroalcohol polymers [1, 5]. It should be noted that all signals were significantly broadened after ~20 min due to the sol-gel transition in the NMR tube, further indicating an efficient polymerization and gelation process in the reaction.

The gelation process of compounds **1** and **2d** in DMSO was also subjected to oscillatory shear rheology analysis (**Figure 2b**, Figure S12) [44, 71]. In the early stage of the reaction, the signals recorded were more scattered due to the values being closer to the detection limit of the instrument. Nevertheless, the loss moduli _G"_ were generally higher than the storage moduli _G'_ during this time range, thereby matching the behavior of liquids [72]. After about 800 s, higher shear moduli were observed, because of the development of polymers, where the loss moduli _G"_ were higher than the storage moduli _G'_. At 825 s, the value of _G'_ dramatically overtook _G"_, indicating the transition from a solution phase to a viscoelastic solid, and marking the critical point of gelation [72, 20]. As the reaction progressed, the shear moduli _G'_ and _G"_ continued to grow until they reached their respective plateaus after approximately 1 h (Figure S12). The resulting transparent organogel showed a _G'_ of 6.6\(\times\)10\({}^{4}\) Pa, a _G"_ of 44.4 Pa and a loss tangent (tan \(\delta\), _G"/G'_) of 6.7\(\times\)10\({}^{-4}\). These rheology results visualized a clear and efficient gelation process and demonstrated the good mechanical performance of the obtained gel.

The gelation time under different feed concentrations of the starting materials, determined by the tube inversion method, was furthermore investigated (**Figure 3a**). When the loading concentration of trialdehyde **1** was lower than 0.3 M, no gelation was observed in the reaction between compounds **1** and **2d** in DMSO, pointing at weaker polymer entanglement and hampered incorporation of solvent molecules under such dilute conditions. However, gel formation occurred readily in more concentrated solutions, in which the gelation time

decreased with the increase of feed concentration in the range of 0.3 M-0.5 M. This is in agreement with the fact that denser and more entangled polymer networks, resulting from more concentrated systems, can hold the solvent more easily.[73]

The effect of the catalyst loading on the gelation process was next evaluated (**Figure 3b**). In the system with 5 mol% of added Et\({}_{3}\)N, the DMSO solution of compounds **1** and **2d** gelated in 35 min. With higher loadings, the gelation time decreased significantly, reaching a value of 7 min at 25 mol% NE\({}_{3}\). This gelation time effect is consistent with the reaction rate dependency on the catalyst concentration in nitroaldol polymerization systems.[1]

The reaction temperature was also varied in order to evaluate the thermal effects on the gelation process (**Figure 3c**). In the range of 25-60 \({}^{\circ}\)C, the solution gelated more rapidly with the increase in temperature, associated with accelerating the reaction rate and promoting polymerization.[74, 75] However, when the reaction temperature reached or passed 65 \({}^{\circ}\)C, no gelation or aggregation was observed. This reveals a sharp temperature-dependency of the polymer interactions within the crosslinked network.[76, 77]

The obtained nitroaldol network polymers were found to be insoluble in water, enabling removal of DMSO and triethylamine without significantly affecting the gel structure. When the gels were repeatedly immersed in deionized water and cleared from excess solvent, the gel remained largely intact, albeit becoming more opaque and more brittle. This also resulted in termination of the reversible nitroaldol reaction, thereby preserving the crosslinked polymer networks. In addition, xerogels could be obtained and analyzed without interference from other gel contents upon drying. Moreover, once the dry network polymer was again exposed to DMSO, the xerogel structure absorbed the solvent and reformed a gel within minutes, although with some associated deformation (Figure S15). These results reveal the robustness of the nitroaldol-crosslinked network and its potential applications in absorption.

The FTIR spectra of compounds **1**, **2d** and the solvent-free polymer **3d** revealed that the aldehyde C=O stretch signal at 1705 cm\({}^{-1}\) and the C-H stretch signal at 2873 cm\({}^{-1}\) almost disappeared after the reaction, whereas a broad O-H stretch peak appeared at 3436 cm\({}^{-1}\) in the spectrum of the polymer (**Figure 4a**). These changes indicate consumption of the aldehyde moieties and formation of new hydroxyl groups. In contrast, the stretch signals emanating from the nitro groups remained in the spectrum of dynamer **3d**, although with slight shifts at 1544 cm\({}^{-1}\) and 1368 cm\({}^{-1}\). Furthermore, the C-H stretch signals in the starting materials' spectra were carried over to that of the product, with small energy changes (alkyl C-H at 2931 cm\({}^{-1}\), aromatic C-H at 3075 cm\({}^{-1}\)). These results demonstrate the formation of nitroalcohols and high conversions of the aldehyde and the nitroalkane.[78, 79]

Thermogravimetric analysis of the pre-dried crosslinked polymer **3d** under argon flow showed

three distinct regions. First, the evaporation of absorbed water upon heating until 175 \({}^{\circ}\)C; then a subsequent 30% weight loss mainly due to the pyrolysis of polyalcohols; and finally a slow consistent weight loss from 215 \({}^{\circ}\)C caused by the decomposition of remaining hydrocarbons until the end of the test (**Figure 4b**).[80] These results show that the obtained crosslinked, dried polymers are thermally stable under normal, lower temperature conditions, but decompose at elevated temperatures due to the nature of the formed nitroalcohols.

The self-healing behavior of the formed gels was tested by cutting one piece of gel **3d** into two halves (**Figure 5a-b**), after which the two separate gels were gently put together and kept at room temperature overnight without adding any additional reagents (**Figure 5c**). As shown in **Figure 5d**, the sliced parts fused into one piece, thereby mending the wound caused by the blade. Upon stretching, the healed gel maintained its general shape without breaking. In addition, angular frequency sweeping rheology analysis on gel **3d** (**Figure 5c**) before and after self-healing revealed that both gels showed storage moduli much larger than the loss moduli (_G'_>>_G"_) and that the storage moduli (_G'_) were independent of the frequency at 0-100 rad/s, which is typical for elastic solids.[81] However, compared to the original gel, _G'_ decreased slightly in the healed gel while _G"_ increased, indicating good mechanical strength but slightly higher viscous response due to the damage. These results demonstrate the excellent self-healing ability of the nitroaldol-crosslinked organogels. The dynamic nitroaldol reaction thus contributed to fusing the two separate gels, with the additional diffusion of solvents and polymer chains in the materials.[18, 22] However, both gels showed breakage when the shear frequency was higher than 160 rad/s due to the limitation of their strength (Figure S13).

The reversible nature of the dynamic nitroaldol reaction renders the crosslinked polymers inherently degradable.[1, 5] To demonstrate this, gel **3d** was submerged into nitromethane with additional Et\({}_{3}\)N, and the gel integrity was followed. Rapid degradation was observed, and the gel disappeared within 30 min at r.t. even without stirring (Figure S14). After removing the volatiles, the residue was analyzed by 'H-NMR spectroscopy (**Figure 6b**). Signals corresponding to a trinitroalcohol (**6**, \(\Diamond\), Figure S6) and 1,6-dinitrohexane (**2d**, \(\triangle\)) appeared in the spectrum, revealing that the gel had been digested to small molecules through the reversible reaction. This demonstrates the excellent dynamicity and recyclability of the crosslinked nitroaldol polymers.

## Conclusions

In summary, crosslinked dynamers of network topology in the form of organogels have been synthesized from a trialdehyde and a range of dinitroalkanes through the nitroaldol reaction for the first time. The gelation process could be controlled by adjusting the starting materials,

where a distinct odd-even dependency of the dinitroalkane components was identified. The gel formation could also be tuned by adjusting the reaction conditions with respect to solvent, temperature, concentration, and catalyst loading. Under optimal conditions, rapid gelation times within a few minutes were recorded. The obtained dynamic covalent gels demonstrated fair mechanical and good thermal stability, and displayed excellent self-healing ability, responsiveness, and degradability.

These results showcase a proof-of-concept for dynamic polymer crosslinking using the nitroaldol reaction. This constitutes a new approach to responsive and adaptive network structures, especially self-healable, degradable and recyclable three-dimensional materials. Thus, polymerization, crosslinking, reconstitution, depolymerization, and recycling of the crosslinked polymers can be easily achieved, thanks to the efficient dynamicity of the nitroaldol reaction. This study also expands the scope of dynameric materials in general, and our expectations are that such structures, in addition to the many applications already demonstrated, will help addressing some of the challenges experienced by conventional polymers.
