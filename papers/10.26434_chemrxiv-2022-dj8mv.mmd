**Abstract:**

The chemical transformation of aromatic amino acids has emerged as an attractive alternative to non-selective lysine or cysteine labeling for the modification of biomolecules. However, this strategy has largely been limited by the scope of functional groups and biocompatible reaction conditions available. Herein, we report the implementation of near-infrared-activatable photocatalysts, TITMAPP and \({}^{n}\)-Pr-DMQA\({}^{\ast}\), capable of generating fluoroalkyl radicals for selective tryptophan functionalization within simple and complex biological systems. At the peptide level, a diverse set of iodo-perfluoroalkyl reagents were used to install biorthogonal handles for downstream applications or link inter- or intramolecular tryptophan residues for peptide stapling. We also found this photoredox transformation amenable to biotinylation of intracellular proteins in live cells for downstream confocal imaging and mass spectrometry-based analysis. Given the inherent tissue penetrant nature of near-infrared light we further demonstrated the utility of this technology to achieve photocatalytic protein fluoroalkylation in physiologically relevant tissue and tumor environments.

**Introduction**

Advancement of technologies that allow efficient chemical modification of proteins in physiologically relevant systems for the characterization of protein function, localization, and dynamics remains an important challenge in chemical biology\({}^{1-6}\). This is mainly due to the stringent requirements within complex biological systems that preclude the use of manychemical protein labeling methods. Thus, while several strategies have been developed that permit the direct functionalization of peptides and proteins outside of their native environments[7, 8, 9, 10, 11], chemical transformation methods that are suitable for labeling of proteins in live cells and tissues remain limited.

Historically, the strategy for protein labeling relies on highly abundant and solvent exposed nucleophilic residues such as lysine and cysteine. However, these methods can suffer from the inability to conjugate in a regioselective manner and, in the case of cysteines, require the need for structural disruptions via reductive treatment. To this end, targeting aromatic residues such as tyrosine[12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18], tryptophan[19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27], and histidine[28, 29, 30] have become an attractive protein labeling strategy (Figure 1a). In addition to direct protein labeling, functionalization of these residues can be leveraged for novel peptide modification strategies. In particular, this can have important implications in the development of novel peptide macrocyclization and stapling techniques, whereby two or more sidechains are cross-linked to generate new topological architectures valuable to the medicinal chemistry community[31, 32, 33, 34, 35].

Although fluorine is essentially absent from biology, incorporation of fluoroalkyl groups has been shown to enhance structural stability of peptides and proteins and improve physical properties of protein-based materials[36]. This has recently inspired new tryptophan transformations that includes the direct installation of trifluoromethyl groups within short peptides[37], native protein constructs for 19F NMR analysis[38] and 18F labeled peptides for positron emission tomography (PET) studies[39] using sodium trifluormethanesulfinate under oxidative conditions. In a similar approach, Beier and colleagues utilized a limited scope of fluoroalkylated cyclic hypervalent iodine scaffolds for fluoroalkylation of peptides[40] and proteins[41]. Despite these early demonstrations, the establishment of general and biocompatible strategies that can accommodate a wide range of functional groups on the fluoroalkyl radical is lacking. Moreover, direct fluoroalkylation to bridge tryptophan residues would enable access to novel stapled peptides and in principle provide an ideal approach for labeling proteins in live cells and complex tissue environments.

Over the last decade, photoredx catalysis platforms have had a tremendous impact for activating unreactive functional groups to achieve otherwise challenging transformations. Since many common biomolecules are inert and weakly absorb in the visible light region, this mode of activation has undoubtedly become an attractive biocompatible strategy for labeling[42].

Given the intrinsic value of protein labeling methods for studying biological systems in the context of their physiological environments, tissue penetrant low-energy near-infrared (NIR) light based photoactivable technologies that allow control of catalytic activity for bioconjugation are in high demand. To address this need, we envisaged a photocatalyst that will absorb in the NIR range (\(\lambda>600\) nm) to generate a fluoroalkyl radical under mild conditions to achieve peptide functionalization, protein bioconjugation, and live cell and tissue labeling (Figure 1b and 1c). Along these lines, Rovis and colleagues recently introduced a series of NIR-based Os(II) photocatalysts for a wide range of catalytic reactions[43]. Other NIR-mediated photocatalytic transformations efforts include the use of organic photocatalysts such as methylene blue[44, 45, 46], helical carbenium ion[46] (a known bioimaging agent in live cells)[47], and commonly used photodynamic therapy reagents porphyrin[48] and phthalocyanine photosensizers[49]. Notably, Postigo and colleagues demonstrated the generation of fluoroalkyl radicals from perfluoroalkyl iodides via a phthalocyanine zinc photosensitizer for C-H functionalization of heteroarenes[49].

However, despite this early progress, no NIR light-based method exists to date that is capable of spanning the spectrum from peptide functionalization to protein labeling in live cell and tissue environments. In this manuscript, we disclose the development of a NIR photoredox technology for fluoroalkylation of tryptophan residues to not only access new stapled peptides but also label within cellular and tissue environments for downstream confocal imaging and mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis.

## Results and Discussion

Inspired by these recent reports, we began our investigation with the evaluation of a series of known and commercially available NIR-based photoredox catalysts with a key design element in mind requiring catalyst hydrophilicity for biocompatible conditions. Following an extensive optimization campaign, we found that tryptophan containing peptide substrates underwent efficient C-H fluoroalkylation at room temperature in the presence of water soluble 5,10,15,20-Tetrakis(4-trimethylammoniumophenyl)porphyrin tetra(p-toluenesulfonate) (TTMAPP, **1**, 1 mol %) or helical carbenium ion, \(N^{\prime}\)-di-\(n\)-propyl-1,13-dimethoxyquinacridinium tetrafluoroborate (\({}^{\circ}\)-Pr-DMQA\({}^{\ast}\), **2**, 2.5 mol %) photocatalysts to afford the desired product with excellent conversion (Figure 1d, Table S1) after NIR light irradiation (660 nm) in a biophotoreactor. As previously reported by Postigo[49] the use of colliding and ascorbic acid was found to be crucial for porphyrin catalysts and detrimental in the case of helical carbenium ion catalysts. Finally, control reactions in the absence of either photocatalyst or light resulted in no product formation and quantitative recovery of the starting material (Table S1).

With the optimized conditions in hand, the scope of reactivity and compatibility on tryptophan containing peptides was examined (Table 1). Using this mild protocol with photocatalyst TTMAPP **1**, we achieved Trp-functionalization of simple to relatively complex peptides in moderate to excellent yields (Table 1, 9-18, 33-72% yield, Table S2). Similar yields were obtained when \({}^{n}\)-Pr-DMQA\({}^{+}\)**2** was used only with simple tryptophan substrates (Table 1, 9 & 12). An important feature of this technology to enable conjugation in any biological system

would be the compatibility of different functionalized perfluoroalkyl components. Thus, we next focused on exploring various perfluoroalkyl iodide scaffolds (Table 1). To our delight, perfluoroalkyl substrates that include fluoroalkyl-substituted sulfone, phosphonate, and trifluoromethyl groups were well-tolerated to give desired products in good yields (Table 1, **19-23**, 22-74% yield, Table S2). More importantly, the photocatalytic fluoroalkylation protocol was also compatible with relevant biorthogonal alkynes and azides (Table 1, **24-25**, Table S2) opening up opportunities for further functionalization of the peptides via click chemistry.

substrates with varied linker length as the limiting reagent, photocatalyst TIMAPP **1**, and a radical source to access rigid perfluoroalkyl peptide staples. Under these conditions, a broad range of linear and cyclic peptides (such as disulfide-bridged peptides) successfully undergo Trp-Trp dimerization to give desired products in good yields (Table 2, **26-30**, 29-52% yield). On the other hand, use of excess diiodo-perfluoroalkane allowed for installation of mono-functionalized products with the iodide-moiety (Table S3, 16-55% yield), providing synthetic handles for further derivatization. Based on these results, we next questioned whether this protocol could be used for intramolecular stapling of tryptophan residues. To this end, linear peptide sequences that contained tryptophan residues separated by **1**, 2, 3, or 4 amino acids were evaluated. As shown in Table 2, structurally diverse peptides can be successfully cyclized using this technology. Importantly, different perfluoro linker lengths and native or substituted peptide substrates containing wide-ranging amino acid residues can be cyclized readily under the NIR photocatalytic conditions (**31-34**, 13-25% yield). To the best of our knowledge, this stapling strategy represents the first synthetic platform to access these new peptide architectures.

Having showcased the ability of this methodology to functionalize and staple peptides, we next explored the feasibility of these NIR photocatalysts for tryptophan-based protein labeling. We first evaluated photocatalytic stability of TTMAPP or \({}^{n}\)-Pr-DMQA\({}^{+}\) in the presence of NIR light, PBS buffer, and a newly synthesized biotin-containing iodoperfluoroalkyl reagent (**35**) through UV-Vis analysis and observed a robust catalytic process (Figure S1). Next, proteins of varying sizes including carbonic anhydrase, albumin, phosphorylase B, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were selected as model substrates for protein bioconjugation (Figure 2 and Figure S2). For these labeling reactions, each protein was combined with TTMAPP or \({}^{n}\)-Pr-DMQA\({}^{+}\) and **35** in aqueous buffer (PBS) to induce protein fluoroalkylation via NIR light irradiation at various time points. The resulting protein biotinylation events were then visualized by western blot. TTMAPP (Figure 2b) and \({}^{n}\)-Pr-DMQA\({}^{+}\) (Figure 2c) yielded similar protein biotinylation patterns in a time-dependent fashion. Notably, protein labeling only occurred with NIR light irradiation and photocatalyst with minimal background biotinylation observed in no light controls. To investigate sites of labeling, peptide-based LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on labeled protein revealing a high propensity for covalent attachment to tryptophan residues, as expected, as well as other electron rich-amino acids (Figures 2b and 2c and Table S4) showcasing the versatility of this methodology for protein labeling in physiologically relevant conditions.

The ability of these methods to label proteins under biocompatible conditions led us to next investigate the utility of this NIR-activatable chemistry within the context of live cells. For this, we subjected the colorectal carcinoma cell line, HT-29, to a NIR light labeling time course in the presence of biotin probe [35], ascorbic acid (in the case of TTMAPP) and TTMAPP or \({}^{n}\)-Pr

(b, c) Carbonic anhydrase (30 kDa), albumin (44 kDa), phosphorylase B (97 kDa), or bovine serum albumin (BSA, 66 kDa) were biotinylated with TTMAPP and ascorbic acid (b) or \({}^{n}\)-Pr-DMQA\({}^{*}\) (c) and **35** under NIR light irradiation. Protein labeling was visualized by western blot using streptavidin dye (left). LC-MS/MS peptide mapping confirmed the modification of tryptophan residues on proteins, including surface-exposed W268 and W149 on albumin (right).

DMQA\({}^{+}\) photocatalyst (Figure 3a). Photocatalyst- and time-dependent protein biotinylation was observed by flow cytometry (Figure 3b) showcasing the ability of this technology to label proteins on live cells. To investigate how these labeling conditions impacted cell viability following photoactivation, we performed an irradiation time course in the presence or absence of biotin probe [(35)] and ascorbic acid (in the case of TTMAPP) and observed that increased irradiation time and absence of additives led to decreased cell viability for both the TTMAPP and \({}^{n}\)-Pr-DMQA\({}^{+}\) labeling methods (Figure 3c and Figure S3). Confocal imaging-based analysis of HT-29 cells labeled using \({}^{n}\)-Pr-DMQA\({}^{+}\) revealed photocatalyst- and light irradiation-dependent biotinylation compared to minimal to no biotinylation in the absence of light or \({}^{n}\)-Pr-DMQA\({}^{+}\) (Figure 3d). In contrast, minimal detection of HT-29 cell staining was observed in TTMAPP labeling reactions, likely due to oxidation events that impede cell staining (Figure 3d). Finally, we found this labeling approach suitable for targeted antibody-mediated proximity biotinylation on the cell surface as demonstrated through use of primary antibody (\(\alpha\)-CD45-\({}^{n}\)-Pr-DMQA\({}^{+}\)) or two-antibody (\(\alpha\)-CD45/Secondary antibody-\({}^{n}\)-Pr-DMQA\({}^{+}\)) targeting systems (Figure S4).

We further explored labeled cellular environments using LC/MS-MS-based proteomic analysis. Accordingly, several cancer cell lines were selected that originated from a diverse set of tissue types that included HT29 and SW837 (colon), NCI-H2126 (lung), and HPAC (pancreas). To induce cellular labeling, cells were incubated with TTMAPP, biotin probe (**36**), and ascorbic acid (500 \(\upmu\)M) for 30 minutes and then irradiated for 30 minutes to induce biotinylation. Cells were lysed and biotinylated proteins were enriched using streptavidin beads and subjected to downstream TMT-based proteomic workflows for identification and quantification via LC/MS

MS. Significant protein enrichment was observed across all tested cell lines compared to no light controls (Figures S5 and S6). Gene ontology (GO)[50] analyses of these significantly enriched proteins revealed an overrepresentation of (m)RNA processing and splicing biological processes in three of the four cell lines (SW837, NCI-H2126, and HPAC) (Figure S5). The labeling of (m)RNA binding proteins by TTMAPP can likely be explained based on previous observations that cationic porphyrins interact with and disrupt nucleic acid-based G quadruplex secondary structures[51, 52, 53]. The successful photocatalytic-driven fluoroalkylation achieved in live cells highlights the ability of this approach to label within different cellular compartments.

The use of NIR light offers potential for bioconjugation or labeling in complex biological samples that require penetrance of the activating light source. To demonstrate the utility of NIR-mediated chemistry we performed biotinylation of proteins in primary tissues. Tissue of various physiology including brain, esophagus, and colon were labeled with **36** in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue slices or whole tissue (Figure 4a). Confocal microscopy of colon slices shows biotinylation of proteins when using either TTMAPP or "-Pr-DMQA" mediated labeling (Figure 4b). Whole tissue samples were further processed for LC-MS/MS-based analysis to explore differences between normal and diseased tissues. Through this analysis, we observed that while the overall extent of protein labeling was comparable within healthy and diseased tissue (as evident by the number of significantly enriched proteins), the subcellular localization of enriched proteins was notably different (Figures 4c and 4d and Figures S7 and S8). GO[50] analyses of significantly enriched proteins within healthy brain and esophageal tissue revealed an overrepresentation of mitochondrial localizing proteins while enriched proteins in tumor brain and esophageal tissue displayed more non-specific subcellular localization (Figure 4d and FigureS7). This observation suggests that differences in the cellular biology of tumor and healthy tissue microenvironments may affect the subcellular distribution of catalyst/probe pairs. Importantly, these results demonstrate the ability to achieve NIR-activated fluoroalkylation within more complex and physiologically relevant biological systems.

## Conclusion

In summary, we have developed a novel strategy for tryptophan-specific labeling via NIR-mediated photoredox catalysis. The generation of carbon centered fluoroalkyl radicals using various iodofluoroalkyl substrates allows for easy access to a diverse array of functionalized tryptophan-containing peptides including novel tryptophan-tryptophan linked stapled peptides. This chemistry was well tolerated and directly adaptable for both intracellular and targeted cell surface labeling on live cells. Furthermore, the longer wavelength requirement of this technology enabled protein labeling within patient-derived tissues that was combined with downstream confocal imaging and proteomic analysis to profile unique differences between normal and tumor samples. Together, these experimental results showcase the biocompatibility of tryptophan fluoroalkylation for simple and complex biological applications and open opportunities for expanding into physiologically-relevant _in vivo_ settings for profiling protein environments.
