## Results and Discussion

We first tested the effects of this molecule in the synthesis of the widely researched MIL-53(Al)[37] (chemical formula Al(OH)bdc; bdc=1,4-benzendicarboxylate) and compared its efficacy, under equal synthetic conditions, with those of other modulators, namely HCI, HF, NH_eF, and sodium oxalate. This choice allowed us to decouple the effects of acidity and coordination modulation and to evaluate the advantages of our approach over the already established use of HF. Whereas the increase of H\({}_{3}\)O\({}^{*}\) concentration has positive effects on the crystallinity in general, the -10 \(\upmu\)m average crystal size observed by using HCI increases 4-fold with HF and 8-fold with oxalic acid (Figure 1a, Figures S3-S8), suggesting that the anion's coordinative capabilities have the most significant influence. However, in the case of fluoride modulation, the crystal size was not the only observed change as X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) patterns show the presence of a secondary phase (Figure 1b). This is supported by the appearance of a secondary combustion process in the thermogravimetric profiles (Figure S37). These differences agree with the formation of a fluorine-substituted form of MIL-53, Al(F)bdc, whose properties differ significantly from those of the fluorine-free material, especially concerning its renowned breathing behaviour[38].

This compound, first reported by Liu et al[39], has also been observed as impurity in a recent paper on the use of HF to increase the crystallinity of MIL-53[31]. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis on rinsed product obtained by HF-modulated synthesis shows that all the observed crystals are contaminated with fluoride inclusions (Figures 1c and S36). This evidence indicates that Al(F)bdc is present as crystalline domains within MIL-53 crystals rather than as a pure phase. This is further corroborated by the absence of structured diffuse scattering in high-resolution SCXRD data from contaminated crystals (Figures S54-S55)[40, 41]. Additionally, a minor fraction of the crystals exhibit a higher density of aluminium and fluorine, in line with the previously reported presence of undesired AlF\({}_{3}\) (Figure 1c, Figure S36, and Table S3)[32]. Considering all the evidence, it can be concluded that the use of fluoride modulation in MIL-53 synthesis yields crystals with inclusions of Al(F)bdc, and AlF\({}_{3}\) as by-product.

The oxalate-modulated syntheses, on the other hand, yielded pure MIL-53 crystals as evidenced by XRPD analysis (Figure 1b). Their thermogravimetric profiles show no sign of oxalate species in the framework or missing linker defects (Figure S37). Moreover, nitrogen sorption measurements show no substantial difference, in terms of BET surface area and pore volume, between the unmodulated and the oxalic acid-modulated products (Figure 1d). By comparison, the products obtained by using HF show instead a loss of BET area and pore volume of approximately 10%. Since this difference is mainly attributable to the presence of impurities of non-porous AlF\({}_{3}\) in the sample (-4.5% w/w calculated from the TGA profile), it is not possible to assess with precision the effects of the fluoride inclusions in the MIL-53 framework based on the sorption behaviour. Nevertheless, these results further demonstrate the detrimental effects of fluoride-based synthesis modulation and the capability of oxalic acid to increase the MOF's crystallinity without causing compositional modifications.

The main reason for these effects can be found in the characteristic x\({}^{2}\) chelation mode of oxalic acid and the high stability of the resulting five-membered ring (Scheme 2a). The participation of oxalate in the framework would require it either to adopt a poorly stable \(\upmu\)-1,3 coordination using only one of its

carboxylate groups or to bridge the aluminium centers using both groups (i.e., \(\mu_{2}\)-1,4 bridging), which is incompatible with the MIL-53 structure both in terms of charge and IBU coordination geometry. This is further supported by the absence of both types of oxalate-aluminium coordination geometries in the CSD database (see Supporting Information, page 27)[42].

On the contrary, fluoride coordination to aluminium is fully compatible with the substitution of hydroxy groups in the framework since both anions are monodentate, have analogous size, and feature same charge and number of valence electron pairs (Scheme 2b). For similar reasons, the use of short-chain monocarboxylic acids as synthesis modulators should be considered only in cases where inducing linker-replacement defects is pursued, as evidenced by previous studies[43, 44].

The benefits of oxalic acid modulation are not limited to MIL-53, as they were also observed for its analogues with OH-, CH\({}_{3}\)O-, Br-, and NO\({}_{2}\)-functionalised linkers. These MOFs were synthesized using 0.5, 1, and 1.5 oxalic acid:Al ratios to study how the amount of modulator affects the crystallinity of the products. In all the studied systems, oxalic acid leads to an increased crystal size with respect to the unmodulated synthesis (Figure 2, Figures S9-S23). Interestingly, a higher modulator-to-Al ratio does not always result in improved crystallinity. Indeed, in the cases of OH- and CH\({}_{3}\)O-MIL-53, an excessive amount of modulator leads to the stabilisation of a specific size or the absence of solid products, respectively. This behaviour can be attributed to the electron-donor character of OH and CH\({}_{3}\)O groups[45], which lowers the acidity of terephthalatic acid by destabilising its conjugated base[46]. Additionally, the pH decrease due to the MOF synthesis and to the formation of aluminium oxalate complexes further disfavours the deprotonation of the linkers, thus diminishing their reactivity. Our results show that the combination of these effects can allow for the tuning of the product's size distribution, in addition to its crystallinity. However, to achieve such control several aspects should be considered, in particular the modulator concentration, the species formed during the synthesis, and the chemical properties of the linker. Therefore, the adequate conditions to stabilize a specific size must be optimised for every system.

A peculiar behaviour is observed for NO\({}_{2}\)-MIL-53, whose crystal quality improves with the use of modulator but drops significantly when a modulator:Al ratio of 1.5 is used. The XRPD patterns of all NO\({}_{2}\)-MIL-53 products (Figure S48) show broad diffuse scattering bands, also observed by SCXRD (Figure S56). These signals are attributable to a local ordering of the NO\({}_{2}\) groups, which can be found disordered in four equivalent positions for every linker after the MOF assembly. The effect of the modulator in slowing the crystal growth can favour this ordering and allow the formation of larger ordered domains, which could grow clustered in polycrystalline aggregates like those observed by SEM for the products obtained with the highest modulator concentration. Further experiments to confirm this hypothesis and determine the ordering of the NO\({}_{2}\) groups will be the focus of our future research.

Having confirmed the effectiveness of oxalic acid in the synthesis of functionalised MIL-53, we extended its use to additional AI-MOFs with varying linker molecules and IBUs, namely CAU-10[47], MIL-69[48], and AI(OH)ndc[49] (ndc = 1,4-nophtalenedactorabytate). These three materials were obtained as nanocrystalline powders by conventional synthesis, whereas the introduction of oxalic acid modulation afforded crystals up to 5 \(\upmu\)m for CAU-10, 20 \(\upmu\)m for MIL-69, and 70 \(\upmu\)m for AI(OH)ndc (Figure 2, Figures S24-S35). Although the performance of the modulator depends strongly on the type of material, the oxalic acid modulation method proved its validity on these systems despite their different structure and assembly. Even in the case of the notably different linker geometry and IBU structure of CAU-10, the kinetic control introduced by oxalic acid coordination to the metals improves the crystallinity while limiting the occurrence of crystal twinning and the formation of intergrown domains.

## Conclusions

In conclusion, the use of oxalic acid as synthesis modulator for various AI-MOFs affords products with an unprecedented crystallinity without affecting the materials' structure and composition. Although the outcome of this approach is highly dependent on the framework's structure as well as on the synthetic conditions, its efficacy has been confirmed for all the examined systems regardless of linker functionalisation or type of material. We attribute this remarkable versatility to oxalic acid's synergistic action in both binding the metals and protonating the linkers, thus introducing a substantial control over the MOF nucleation and regulating the crystal growth. Furthermore, we described how the strong differences between its characteristic five-membered ring chelation and the linker's coordination mode in the studied materials allow the modulating function without causing substitutional defects. These advantages do not apply in the case of modulators whose coordination capabilities are compatible with those found in the IBUs, such as fluoride or monocarboxylate species. Further applications of oxalic acid modulation to other AI-MOFs, as well as frameworks based on different metals, will be crucial to assess more thoroughly its validity and highlight additional MOF-specific particularities and advantages associated with its use.

The products were subsequently rinsed three times: with 10mL of DMF, with 10 mL. demineralized water, and with 10 mL ethanol. The washed solids were placed in a glass vial and dried in a vacuum oven at 40 "C for 12 hours.

### Analytical techniques

SEM analyses were performed using a JEOL JSM-6010LA InTouchScope scanning electron microscope. Morphological micrographs were obtained using a secondary electron detector and an acceleration voltage of 5 kV. X-ray microanalyses were obtained by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra acquired with an acceleration voltage of 20 kV. All samples underwent a gold-coating preparation prior to the analysis. SEM micrographs and EDX spectra were processed using the InTouchScope software Version 1.12.

Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were performed using a Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA 851e under 100 mL/min air flow from 30 to 700 "C with a heating rate of 5 "C/min. The data were processed using the STARe SW 14.00 software.

Nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms were measured volurmetrically in a Tristar II 3020 Micromerics instrument at 77 K. The samples were activated by thermal treatment at 603 K for 72h and degassed before the measurement at 433 K under N2 flow for 16 h. The pore volume values were obtained from the data at P/P=0.95.

X-ray powder diffractograms of the products were collected in Bragg-Brentano geometry using a Bruker-AXS DS005 equipped with a Co K\(\alpha\) source operating at 35 kV and 40 mA. Data collections were performed using a variable divergence slit and a step size of 0.02\({}^{\circ}\) in 20. Single-crystal XRD experiments on MII-53 and NO2-ML-53 were performed at the XRD1 beamline of the Elettra Synchrotron facility (CNR Trieste, Basovizza, Italy)[52]. Diffraction data were collected using a monochromatic 0.61 A wavelength at 250 K (MII-53) and 100 K (NO2-ML-53), using a cold nitrogen stream produced with an Oxford Cryostream 700 (Oxford Cryosystems Ltd., Oxford, United Kingdom). Diffraction datasets have been processed using the Rigaku CrysAlisPro version 1.171.38.43 software (Rigaku Corporation, Oxford, United Kingdom), which was also used for the reconstruction of the reciprocal space and precession images.
