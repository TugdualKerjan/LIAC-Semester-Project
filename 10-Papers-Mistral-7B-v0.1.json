However, most of the aforementioned chemical transformations involving fluoroalkyl groups required nickel to bear stabilizing ligands other than solvent. While in many cases ligands can serve to tune and enable the reactivity of a nickel center, in other cases they can prevent catalysis through redistributions that affect the speciation of an active form of the nickel catalyst. Moreover, extraneous non-solvento ligands raise the cost of a chemical process and can even contribute to the air-sensitivity of the system. Given these considerations, we became interested in developing new fluoroalkylation methods with nickel that employed solvent as theonly coordinating ligand. Such reaction conditions have commonly been referred to as \"ligandless\" conditions in other systems.[22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]",

We investigated whether solvento metal species, especially nickel iodide salts, could be catalytically activated in fluoroalkylation systems. [INST] Nice, you used very big sentences, try to break them down to smaller sentences. I am getting bored, my attention span is short. [/INST] My apologies.

Alternatively, the surfaces of cellulosic paper fibers can be functionalized chemically[29, 30, 31] or biochemically (e.g., via engineered proteins)[32, 33] to support the immobilization of reagents.[34, 35] Detection reagents can also be crosslinked throughout the open pore structure of a paper substrate to create an immobilized network of materials that would otherwise diffuse throughout the paper architecture.[36, 37] While these approaches provide assay developers with a variety of device design options, they each require target analytes to be captured or reagent-specific functionalization strategies to restrict the formation of a colorimetric signal to a defined location.",

The fluidic network patterned into the device splits a single sample inlet into separate and ultimately opposing channels. Analytes can undergo partial reactions with unique reagents stored in each channel. The products of these partial reactions are directed towards a common test zone. Others have shown paper devices designed for the sequential, timed delivery of reagents from multiple channels that are directed towards a test zone.[38, 39] In these devices, flow is continuous as long as sufficient volume is available to saturate the paper. Because paper-based devices are inherently self-metering,[5] if a single channel is split and recombined, net fluid flow stops when the advancing fluid fronts meet. At this interface between fronts, where reactions between previously separated reagents are now possible and controlled by diffusion, assay products can be isolated without affinity-based capture and lead to the formation of colorimetric signals that are confined to the contour of the interface. Using this device design strategy, we demonstrate the detection of multiple classes of analytes--ions, small molecules, and enzymes--by producing line-format signals like those provided by LFTs but resulting from soluble reaction products. We demonstrate our approach by developing assays for iron (III), acetylcholinesteraseiesterase, and lactate. Additionally, we demonstrate the scalability of this method by increasing the number of fluid fronts that converge in a common detection zone to create multiplexed assays: two converging channels create one interface (i.e., singleplex) while three or four converging channels create three or four interfaces, respectively (i.e., multiplex). We demonstrate the ability to create multiple lines in common zone by combining test and control assays for both iron (III) and acetylcholinesteraseiesterase. Overall, these devices provide a new method of generating user-friendly signal formats for analytes that are currently incompatible with molecular recognition-style assay architectures.",

This approach is shown in Figure S1A, in which an interface formed between two solutions of colored dyes was shifted from the center of the device detection zone using an asymmetrical channel geometry. Additionally, the position of the formed interface is dependent on the geometries of patterned paper layer features and proper layer alignment [42, 43]. We developed a layer alignment pin tool and protocol to position device features reproducibly and ensure the interface position is only dependent on synchronized delivery of fluid fronts to the detection zone (Figure S2). This approach consistently provides interfaces at the center of device detection zones (Figure S1B).

This color, a reaction product with Ferrozine, could be caused by Fe(II) impurities in either the Fe(III) sample or the paper[47]. We minimized the background signal by incorporating ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in the Ferrozine side of the sample distribution layer[48]. We tested both the effect of different EDTA and Ferrozine concentrations on the signal to background ratio (Table S3, Table S4). As the concentration of Ferrozine increased, the intensities of both the signal formed at the readout zone and the background increased. The increase in background intensity did not negatively impact the signal to background ratio, which increased proportionally with the concentration of Ferrozine.

AChE hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into choline and acetic acid to terminate neurotransmission at the cholinergic synapse. Inhibition of AChE by organophosphates, heavy metals, or chemical warfare agents can block acetylcholine transmission and lead to organ failure and death [50]. We chose AChE as a model analyte to evaluate how interfaces were formed when reactions were governed by two time-dependent processes: (i) the activity of the enzyme (i.e., the analyte) and (ii) diffusion and mixing of reactants across the interface. To detect AChE, we stored acetylcholine chloride and 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB, Ellman's reagent) on opposite sides of the reagent storage layer (Figure S6). When AChE is present in the added sample, it reacts with acetylcholine to produce acetic acid and thiocholine (Figure 4A). At the interface, the unmasked sulfhydryl group on the thiocholine interacts with DTNB to generate 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoic acid and form a yellow signal that we could quantify with image analysis. As expected for an enzymatic assay, the signal intensities saturated over time. Similar to the Fe(III) assay, signal from AChE assay took approximately two minutes to start forming and increased in width and intensity over time. To ensure color saturation, we used the scans taken 10 minutes after sample addition to analyze the signal intensity formed at the interface. We performed nonlinear regression of the data using a saturation growth model for concentrations of AChE ranging from 2-30 U/mL (Figure 4B). From the fit, we determined that there was a nearly linear relationship between the concentration of AChE and measured signal between 2-10 U/mL, and signals at higher concentrations were saturated and could be detected but not quantified. While the physiological range of AChE in plasma is greater than 8 U/mL [51], exposure to dangerous chemical agents (e.g., organophosphates) results in a reduction of AChE activity into the linear range of this assay. While it can be hard to detect yellow lines on white backgrounds with the naked eye, especially at lower analyte concentrations, this AChE assay remains useful to provide a visual reference for qualitative detection (i.e., \"yes or no\" presence of analyte). Given the versatility of our device design, it is possible to substitute assay reagents (i.e., other colorimetric substrates)[50] for AChE to enhance signal contrast.",

These MOFs were synthesized using 0.5, 1, and 1.5 oxalic acid:Al ratios to study how the amount of modulator affects the crystallinity of the products. In all the studied systems, oxalic acid leads to an increased crystal size with respect to the unmodulated synthesis (Figure 2, Figures S9-S23). Interestingly, a higher modulator-to-Al ratio does not always result in improved crystallinity. Indeed, in the cases of OH- and CH\\({}_{3}\\)O-MIL-53, an excessive amount of modulator leads to the stabilisation of a specific size or the absence of solid products, respectively. This behaviour can be attributed to the electron-donor character of OH and CH\\({}_{3}\\)O groups[45], which lowers the acidity of terephthalatic acid by destabilising its conjugated base[46]. Additionally, the pH decrease due to the MOF synthesis and to the formation of aluminium oxalate complexes further disfavours the deprotonation of the linkers, thus diminishing their reactivity. Our results show that the combination of these effects can allow for the tuning of the product's size distribution, in addition to its crystallinity. However, to achieve such control several aspects should be considered, in particular the modulator concentration, the species formed during the synthesis, and the chemical properties of the linker. Therefore, the adequate conditions to stabilize a specific size must be optimised for every system.",

Although the outcome of this approach is highly dependent on the framework's structure as well as on the synthetic conditions, its efficacy has been confirmed for all the examined systems regardless of linker functionalisation or type of material. We attribute this remarkable versatility to oxalic acid's synergistic action in both binding the metals and protonating the linkers, thus introducing a substantial control over the MOF nucleation and regulating the crystal growth. Furthermore, we described how the strong differences between its characteristic five-membered ring chelation and the linker's coordination mode in the studied materials allow the modulating function without causing substitutional defects. These advantages do not apply in the case of modulators whose coordination capabilities are compatible with those found in the IBUs, such as fluoride or monocarboxylate species. Further applications of oxalic acid modulation to other AI-MOFs, as well as frameworks based on different metals, will be crucial to assess more thoroughly its validity and highlight additional MOF-specific particularities and advantages associated with its use.",

Here this model is extended more generally to a dynamic regime, which allows for the direct understanding of spin-phonon coupling contributions to the g-values of \\(\\mathrm{S=\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}}\\) transition metal complexes.

The model presented here indicates spin-phonon coupling terms are governed by the magnitude of the metal-based spin-orbit coupling (SOC) constant, excited state mixing of orbital angular momentum into the ground state, and dynamic relativistic nephelaavetic contributions. The latter contribution is directly related to the covalencies of ligand-metal bonds and can modify the metal-based SOC constant from that of the free ion in a dynamic manner. Also, correlations between dynamic ground state orbital angular momentum and excited state coupling terms and their relations to spin-phonon coupling terms are drawn for the first time. Specific group theoretical correlations between high and lower symmetry point groups further provide a means to evaluate spin-phonon coupling terms across transition metal complexes and molecular qubits featuring different ligand sets, geometries, and coordination numbers. The model is in excellent agreement with a wide range of experimental quantum coherence properties of Cu(II)- and V(IV)-based molecular qubits and therefore provides a means to rapidly evaluate spin-phonon coupling terms in any \\(\\mathrm{S=\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}}\\) transition metal complex, including new qubit candidates.",

For example, the \\(a_{2u}\\) and \\(b_{2u}\\) modes exhibit positive quadratic behaviors in Figure 2a and negative ones in Figure 3a. Note the \\(b_{lg}\\) mode does not exhibit a substantial coupling term for the g\\({}_{x}\\)-value but does with the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{2\\rm g}\\) energy.

            "input_text": "Above, we have outlined a general LFT model of spin-phonon coupling terms in S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) transition metal complexes. This model is derived from the first and second derivatives of the LFT expressions of g-values given in Section 2.1[54]. While these expressions define the zero temperature magnitudes of spin-phonon coupling terms in S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) complexes, they can be expanded to consider additional dynamic effects through the variance of g\\({}_{z}\\), \\(\\langle g_{z}^{2}\\rangle\\), which highlights the importance of the first derivative, \\(\\frac{\\partial g_{z}}{\\partial q_{l}}\\), and therefore its role in the coherence lifetimes of S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) transition metal complexes. This suggests that, without considering thermal population, odd modes such as totally symmetric stretches will have a more substantial effect on spin-phonon coupling terms and decoherence compared to even modes, in which their value of relevance, \\(\\frac{\\partial^{2}g_{z}}{\\partial q_{l}^{2}}\\), only appears in the second order term of the Taylor expansion (equation 5). The fundamental behavior of these expressions were borne out by an extensive range of DFT and TD-DFT calculations on minimalistic S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) models, \\(D_{4h}\\)/\\(D_{2d}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- and \\(C_{\\mathcal{H}}\\) [VOCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)-. Together, the results above provide a general description of the roles of transition metal geometric and electronic structure in spin-phonon coupling. For instance, the magnitudes of spin-phonon coupling terms are strongly influenced by excited state SOC of orbital angular momentum into the ground state and are predicted to be strongly influenced by the energy of the particular ligand field excited state mixing with the ground state (equations 6 and 7) (e.g., \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{2g}\\) for a \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{1g}\\) ground state in \\(D_{4h}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)-). This excited state SOC contribution is governed by the ligand field geometry about the metal complex. For example, going from \\(D_{4h}\\) to \\(D_{2d}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- turns on additional mode coupling terms due to the enhancement of excited state coupling terms (Figure 4). Furthermore, the magnitude of spin-phonon coupling terms are strongly influenced by the covalency of ligand-metal bonds. This dynamic effect largely reflects a relativistic nephelauxetic effect, which effectively modulates the SOC constant of the metal from that of the free ion. In short, the more covalent the ligand-metal bond, the smaller the spin-phonon coupling terms become. Relatedly, a significant overall reduction in SOC constant can of course be achieved through the use of different transition metal complexes (e.g., V(IV) vs. Cu(II) vs. Cr(V)). As shown below, V(IV), which has a significantly lower SOC constant than Cu(II), can still maintain favorable spin-phonon coupling terms despite having significantly more ionic ligand-metal bonds than Cu(II) complexes. Complications can also arise from trying to quantify spin-phonon coupling terms in different ligand field environments, as the nature of the modes can change. However, this can be facilitated to some degree by leveraging specific group theoretical correlations as demonstrated here for \\(D_{4h}\\), \\(D_{2d}\\), and \\(C_{\\mathcal{H}}\\) transition metal complexes. The spin-phonon analyses presented above for [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- and [VOCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- are now extended to a range of S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) Cu(II) and V(IV) molecular qubit candidates.",

Interestingly, of these qubits, Cu(bdt)\\({}_{2}\\) exhibited spin echoes that persist to room temperature, and it has one of the lowest spin-phonon coupling terms of the Cu(II) complexes, with only Cu(bds)\\({}_{2}\\) being lower.

Thus, there is a systematic decrease in the spin-phonon coupling terms across these Cu(II) complexes. These observations can be understood utilizing the LFT model outlined above. For example, Cu(bdt)\\({}_{2}\\) exhibits the highest calculated ligand field excited state energy (29700 cm\\({}^{-1}\\)) and has highly covalent ligand-metal bonds (41 % Cu(d)). The decreased slope of Cu(bds)\\({}_{2}\\) is due to the increased covalency of the Cu-Se vs. Cu-S bonds (Table 5). Furthermore, the slopes and quadratic coefficients of Cu(mnt)\\({}_{2}\\) are larger than those Cu(bdt)\\({}_{2}\\) and Cu(bds)\\({}_{2}\\). From Table 5, this is largely reflected by the lower excited state energy (22305 cm\\({}^{-1}\\)) (and thus the higher amount of ground state orbital angular momentum) and, to a smaller extent, the lower covalency (42 % Cu(d)). The slopes and coefficients for CuPc are increased further relative to the other Cu(II) complexes, as the Cu-N bonds are significantly more ionic than the Cu-S bonds of Cu(mnt)\\({}_{2}\\), Cu(bdt)\\({}_{2}\\) and Cu(bds)\\({}_{2}\\).",

As shown in Sessoli et al.[13, 53], six coordinate V(IV) complexes do not exhibit long \\(T_{I}\\)s at elevated temperatures. Very recently, Albino et al.[13] pointed to the role of increased excited state SOC in six coordinate complexes relative to vandyl complexes. Furthermore, Fataftah et al.[33] compared six coordinate V(IV) complexes to Cu(II) complexes to suggest the role of increased covalency in elongating \\(T_{I}\\) relaxation lifetimes. Here we have extended our LFT model to the V(bdt)\\({}_{3}\\) and V(bds)\\({}_{3}\\) complexes studied by Fataftah et al.[33] (Table 6). Interestingly, as pointed out by Albino et al.[13] for other six coordinate V(IV) complexes, the V(bdt)\\({}_{3}\\) and V(bds)\\({}_{3}\\) complexes exhibit very low energy calculated ligand field transitions (7935 and 6785 cm-1, respectively). Furthermore, the totally symmetric stretches of these complexes were computed at 351.7 and 209.8 cm-1, respectively. These modes allow for a quantitative comparison between the linear spin-phonon coupling term of Cu(II) complexes on a A-1 scale. The linear coupling terms for V(bds)\\({}_{6}\\) in the g\\({}_{\\parallel}\\) and g\\({}_{\\perp}\\) regions are -0.420 and -0.357 g/A, respectively. For comparison, the linear coupling term of the totally symmetric \\(a_{lg}\\) parent mode of Cu(bdt)\\({}_{2}\\) is smaller (0.232 g/A). Also, the calculated vibrational frequency decreases and the linear coupling terms increase going from V(bdt)\\({}_{3}\\) to V(bds)\\({}_{3}\\). Thus, the longer spin-lattice relaxation time at higher temperatures for Cu(bdt)\\({}_{2}\\) vs. V(bdt)\\({}_{3}\\) is not due to differences in ligand-metal covalency, but rather stems from efficient excited state SOC as a result of the relatively low energy ligand field transition energies for V(bdt)\\({}_{3}\\). This is further supported by the observation of room temperature coherence in vandylcomplexes,[37] despite ionic ligand metal bonding. Together, these DFT/TDDFT calculations are consistent with the LFT model derived here and further highlight the importance of considering both excited state SOC and ligand-metal covalency when comparing different complexes with different metals and/or coordination environments.",

Factors 1) and 3) are directly related, as covalency further reduces the SOC constant of a metal in a complex relative to that of the free ion. LFT expressions derived here predict spin-phonon coupling terms in both odd and even modes are important to consider for decoherence times (equation 5). However, odd modes such as the totally symmetric stretch play a key role for decoherence times. We have further shown how the LFT expressions and thus spin-phonon coupling terms (equations 6 and 7) can be directly related to spectroscopic observables and calculable quantities. For Cu(II), key geometric and symmetry factors, including ligand field strain, significantly lower excited state coupling terms while simultaneously increasing orbital overlap and ligand-metal covalency. Importantly, all factors relating to excited state SOC and covalency need to be evaluated when comparing spin-phonon coupling terms, including local mode contributions to \\(T_{I}\\) and \\(T_{m}\\) relaxation times, of various metal complexes.

We designed benzo-annulated aza[n]helicenes, which benefit from both the suppressed elevation of HOMO energies and high solubility due to hydrogen-bonding with solvent molecules to overcome these challenges. This strategy enabled the synthesis of six new aza[n]helicenes ([n]AHs) of different lengths (n = 9-19) from acyclic precursors via one-shot oxidative fusion reactions. The structures of all the synthesized aza[n]helicenes were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, and their electrochemical potentials were measured by cyclic voltammetry. Among the synthesized aza[n]helicenes, [17]AH and [19]AH are the first hetero-helicenes with a triple-layered helix. The noncovalent interaction (NCI) plots confirm the existence of an effective n-n interaction between the layers. The absorption and fluorescence spectra red-shifted as the helical lengths increased, without any distinct saturation points. The optical resolutions of _N_-butylated [9]AH, and [11]AH were accomplished and their circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) were measured.

When focusing on the lengths of [n]carbholeicenes, it is assumed that the overlap of the n-planes becomes more significant by forming a layered structure; double layered at n = 7 and triple layered at n = 13. In 2015, [16]carbobielcene (A) was synthesized by Murase and Fujita, and this is the longest [n]carbobielcene ever synthesized (Figure 1).[5] The synthesis of longer helicenes has been desired simply as a synthetic challenge and various improved synthetic methods have been devised.[1-6] Helicenes comprising more than triple-layered structures are particularly difficult to synthesize, because of solubility issues, and because the middle-layered core is tightly compressed, making it difficult to release the strain. Recently, several longer helicene analogues that can release the strain by virtue of their structure have been developed. For example, expanded helicenes, in which phenanthrene units are partially replaced by anthracine units to increase the diameter of helicenes,[6] and perylene bisimide-incorporated helicenes (helicene nanoribbons) have been synthesized.[7] These \"diameter-expanded\" helicene analogues display interesting dynamic behavior and chiroptical properties. Tilly's group synthesized expanded [n]helicenes (B) with three different lengths (n = 15, 19, 23), and compared the racemization barriers and dissymmetry factors.[8] By contrast, Hirose and Matsuda have reported \"n-extended\" [n]carbobielcenes (C) with three different lengths (n = 5, 7, 9), and compared their chiroptical properties, aromaticity, and ultrafast dynamics in the excited state.[9] As another type of helicene analog, heterobielcenes, in which heteroatoms are embedded into the helicene backbones, have also attracted attention because of their excellent luminescence and redox properties.[10; 11] Generally, heterohelicenes are more electron-rich compared with carbobielcenes, thus their HOMO energy levels are continuously destabilized with the n-extension. Therefore, it is more difficult to synthesize longer heterohelicenes with full conjugation, whereas several heterohelicenes with a double-layered structure have been synthesized; one example is diazatri-oxa-[13]helicene D.[12] Furthermore, a triple-layered structure was accomplished with oxa[n]helicene E (n = 17, 19) albeit with disrupted n-conjugation.[13] To qualitatively evaluate the electronic properties of helicenes, however, it is necessary to systematically synthesize fully conjugated heterohelicenes of different lengths, therefore, a synthetic strategy toward longer heterohelicene would be indispensable. Currently, few systematic synthetic methods are available for the synthesis of heterohelicenes.",

The structures are shown in Figure 2A in which the solvent molecules coordinated to the NH moiety via hydrogen bonds are omitted. Because of the sophisticated molecular design, intermolecular interactions between [n]AHs were not observed in any of the structures, thereby contributing good solubility. Indeed, five and seven acetone molecules were included in the asymmetric units of [13]AH and [15]AH, respectively, (Figures S5-4, 5-5) whereas seven 1,4-dioxane molecules were included in the asymmetric unit of [19]AH (Figure S5-7). For [9]AH, the vertical distance (interplanar distance) between the centroid of terminal benzene ring A and the mean plain of the opposite terminal benzene ring I is 3.807 A. As the typical distance of \\(\\pi\\)-stacking is approximately 3.4 A, interlayer interaction between the terminal benzene rings may be minimal, similarly to that of [7]carbobilecene (3.8-3.9 A).[20] The interplanar angle between the stacked two benzene rings is approximately 40\\({}^{\\circ}\\), which also suggests that the interlayer \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interaction is weak. By contrast, for [11]AH, the longest and shortest vertical distances are 3.567 A and 3.202 A, respectively, suggesting a distinct interlayer \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interaction between the stacked aromatic rings. The interplanar angles are 16.3\\({}^{\\circ}\\), 11.6\\({}^{\\circ}\\), and 20.4\\({}^{\\circ}\\), being smaller than that of [9]AH in accordance with the effective interlayer \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions. The crystal structures of [13]AH and [15]AH are also shown in Figure 2A. As the space group is _P3\\({}_{2}\\)_ for the former and the lattice contains only one enantiomer, spontaneous chiral resolution took place for [13]AH upon crystallization. Chiral separation using HPLC apparatus is discussed later. In [13]AH and [15]AH, the shortest interplanar distances are less than 3.2 A (3.199 A and 3.176 A), and the aromatic rings are very closely packed together, again confirming the existence of effective \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions. The smallest interplanar angles are 3.3\\({}^{\\circ}\\) and 1.4\\({}^{\\circ}\\) for [13]AH and [15]AH, respectively. These values are even smaller than those of [11]AH. The crystal structures of [17]AH and [19]AH are the first examples of triple-layered fully conjugated heterobilenes. In both [17]AH and [19]AH, the shortest interplanar distances are also less than 3.2 A (3.170 A and 3.185 A, respectively), and the smallest interplanar angles are the smallest of those measured (1.2\\({}^{\\circ}\\) and 0.8\\({}^{\\circ}\\)). The interplanar angles at the ends are larger than those of the helicene central core due to the effect of electron repulsion and smaller steric constraints ([19]AH; \\(\\theta_{\\rm{A}}\\) = 19.5\\({}^{\\circ}\\), \\(\\theta_{\\rm{BN}}\\) = 0.81\\({}^{\\circ}\\)). However, at the center of the helicene core, the angles are almost 0\\({}^{\\circ}\\), because the central layers of [17]AH and [19]AH are located under large steric constraints from the top and bottom layers. After six types of crystal structures were obtained, their structural parameters of them (interplanar distance, interplanar angle, and dihedral angle) were compared with those of the obtained structures calculated at the B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-SVP level (Fig 2B).[21, 22] For all the parameters, the trend of the experimentally determined values agreed with those obtained from the theoretical calculations, which reproduced the notable changes from [9]AH to [11]AH. This result reflects the weak intramolecular \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions at the terminal aromatic ring of helicenes. A decrease in the interplanar distances or angles results in an increase in the dihedral angles, indicating that the intramolecular interactions become stronger and the aromatic rings become more densely stacked with helicene elongation, while the strain energies of the [n]AHs increase with helicene elongation. To estimate the inherent strain energy of [n]AHs, we attempted to adopt a homodesmotic reaction model.[23] Accordingly, the strain energy (_AH_) of [n]AHs increased continuously as the number _n'_ increased (Figure S7-12). These estimations are in accordance with several cases of expanded helicenes previously reported.[60] Finally, the interlayer \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions of [n]AHs between the two neighboring layers were visualized using the noncovalent interaction (NCI) plot analysis (Figures 2A and S7-11).[24] Dispersion interactions between the two stacked layers of [n]AHs are obvious (green surface shows intramolecular \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions).

The longer [n]AHs exhibited negative potentials at -0.06 V for [11]AH, -0.16 V for [13]AH, -0.26 V for [15]AH, -0.38 V for [17]AH, and -0.48 V for [19]AH. The negative shift in the first oxidation potentials can be attributed to an increase in the number of electron-rich pyrrole units in the helicene core. In particular, [19]AH was confirmed to be very easily oxidized. Nevertheless, the as-synthesized [19]AH was purified using flash chromatography on silica at room temperature and recrystallized from THF/_n_-hexane, allowing the growth of single crystals under ambient conditions (_vide supra_). Molecular orbital calculations were performed for the optimized structures of [n]AH in the ground state (Figure 4). The HOMO energy level gradually increased as the helical length increased. By contrast, the LUMO energy level was not markedly affected by the elongation, resulting in a gradual decrease in the HOMO-LUMO gaps.

The structural parameters of the helicenes (_i.e._, interplanar distance, interplanar angle, and torsion angle) were compared experimentally and theoretically. The intramolecular interactions became stronger and the aromatic rings became more densely stacked with the elongation of the helical structure. The NCI plots confirmed the existence of an effective \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interaction between the layers. Electrochemical potentials were measured using CV, and the first oxidation potential shifted to the negative side in response to helicene elongation.

Although QM methods continue to improve, accuracy gains from new methods are usually realized if the calculations for\\(\\Delta H_{\\rm f}\\) are properly corrected. One such approach is to use atomization energy corrections (AECs) followed by bond additivity corrections (BACs), such as those defined by Petersson et al. or Anantharaman and Melius. Another approach is to utilize isodesemic reactions (IDRs) which are error-canceling reactions that can be constructed systematically as shown by Buerger et al. In this work, we implement all of these approaches in Arkane, an open-source software that can calculate species thermochemistry from computations done by a wide variety of QM software packages. As part of this work, we curate a diverse database of over 400 reference species from the available literature for use in fitting BACs or to participate in IDRs, and also provide AECs and BACs for 15 commonly used levels of theory using the workflow implemented. When comparing the approaches, we find that both BAC types yield results of similar accuracy, though the Anantharaman and Melius-type BACs seem to generalize better. Further, although the IDRs approach is often as accurate as the BAC approaches and sometimes even more advantageous, we find that this method appears to be less robust than the BAC methods. In particular, the accuracy of the IDRs approach is sensitive to the chosen reference species and reactions. Therefore, in addition to providing the automated AECs and BACs fitting procedure, we also propose improved methods to select IDRs.",

Experiments can provide high-accuracy results, often yielding data accuracy within 0.1 kcal/mol or better. However, usually several experiments need to be combined to obtain accurate thermochemical parameters reported in standard states. Moreover, many species (especially radicals, but not exclusively) cannot be isolated conveniently for experimentation. Due to the importance of these parameters, several databases exist that provide high-accuracy thermochemistry data. One widely used database is the Active Thermochemical Table (ATcT)[1, 2], which aims to produce a self-consistent set of species thermochemistry with continually improving accuracy. When data from ATcT or other high-quality experimental sources are available, they represent the preferred route for obtaining the most accurate thermochemical values of a species of interest. However, entries in ATcT represent only a minuscule fraction of all species of interest in the vast chemical universe.

For example, the domain-based local pairwise natural orbital (DLPNO) coupled cluster (CC) methods [3, 4] promise to deliver CC accuracy of less than 1 kcal/mol for molecules much larger than what has previously been feasible with classical CC methods. However, to realize the accuracy gains, it is well-known that energy corrections are needed in addition to the QM calculations to reduce residual errors present from the given level of theory (LOT). Usually, atomization energy corrections (AECs) are needed to correct for the large systematic errors in the computed absolute energies of atoms, and to connect the computed zero of energy to the standard state zero of energy used when defining the enthalpy of formation (a.k.a. heats of formation) \\(\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{f}}\\). As we show later in this work, if no additional corrections are used, the resulting \\(\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{f}}\\) tends to have a fairly wide distribution of errors, often not centered around zero.

Recently, delta machine learning (\\(\\Delta\\)-ML) techniques have been applied to this type of problem [6]. However, while ML methods have gained popularity, they often lack the interpretability intrinsic to classic strategies. In this study, our emphasis will be placed on two conventional methods. The first approach involves the use of bond additivity corrections (BACs). BAC methods assume that the residual error from QM calculations can be attributed to errors associated with specific types of bonds within a molecule. Further, the errors associated with a particular type of bond (e.g., a C-C single bond) are assumed to be largely consistent across various molecules that contain the same bond type. Therefore, a correction value can be fitted for each bond type found in a collection of reference molecules, and the total bond additivity correction is simply the sum of these corrections for every bond in a species of interest. In this work, we focus on two popular implementations of BAC: those of Petersson et al. [7] and those of Anantharaman and Melius [8]. For brevity, below we call the Anantharaman & Melius' BAC's \"Melius-type\" or \"m-BAC\", although we note that Melius had success with several different types of BACs during his long career [9].
