However, most of the aforementioned chemical transformations involving fluoroalkyl groups required nickel to bear stabilizing ligands other than solvent. While in many cases ligands can serve to tune and enable the reactivity of a nickel center, in other cases they can prevent catalysis through redistributions that affect the speciation of an active form of the nickel catalyst. Moreover, extraneous non-solvento ligands raise the cost of a chemical process and can even contribute to the air-sensitivity of the system. Given these considerations, we became interested in developing new fluoroalkylation methods with nickel that employed solvent as theonly coordinating ligand. Such reaction conditions have commonly been referred to as \"ligandless\" conditions in other systems.[22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]",

The covalency was analyzed, on one hand, by changes in the concentration of the electron density at the BCP along with changes in the delocalization indices. On the other hand, energy densities show the polarization of the covalent bond by looking at the ratios between potential [V(r)] and kinetic [G(r)] energy densities, which for partial covalent bonds lie in between values of 1 and 2. The total energy density shows the degree of covalency that is represented by the level of predominance of the potential over the kinetic energy density [42].",

The fluidic network patterned into the device splits a single sample inlet into separate and ultimately opposing channels. Analytes can undergo partial reactions with unique reagents stored in each channel. The products of these partial reactions are directed towards a common test zone. Others have shown paper devices designed for the sequential, timed delivery of reagents from multiple channels that are directed towards a test zone.[38, 39] In these devices, flow is continuous as long as sufficient volume is available to saturate the paper. Because paper-based devices are inherently self-metering,[5] if a single channel is split and recombined, net fluid flow stops when the advancing fluid fronts meet. At this interface between fronts, where reactions between previously separated reagents are now possible and controlled by diffusion, assay products can be isolated without affinity-based capture and lead to the formation of colorimetric signals that are confined to the contour of the interface. Using this device design strategy, we demonstrate the detection of multiple classes of analytes--ions, small molecules, and enzymes--by producing line-format signals like those provided by LFTs but resulting from soluble reaction products. We demonstrate our approach by developing assays for iron (III), acetylcholinesteraseiesterase, and lactate. Additionally, we demonstrate the scalability of this method by increasing the number of fluid fronts that converge in a common detection zone to create multiplexed assays: two converging channels create one interface (i.e., singleplex) while three or four converging channels create three or four interfaces, respectively (i.e., multiplex). We demonstrate the ability to create multiple lines in common zone by combining test and control assays for both iron (III) and acetylcholinesteraseiesterase. Overall, these devices provide a new method of generating user-friendly signal formats for analytes that are currently incompatible with molecular recognition-style assay architectures.",

This approach is shown in Figure S1A, in which an interface formed between two solutions of colored dyes was shifted from the center of the device detection zone using an asymmetrical channel geometry. Additionally, the position of the formed interface is dependent on the geometries of patterned paper layer features and proper layer alignment [42, 43]. We developed a layer alignment pin tool and protocol to position device features reproducibly and ensure the interface position is only dependent on synchronized delivery of fluid fronts to the detection zone (Figure S2).

The time required to generate visible signals can vary based on the grade of paper used to fabricate the device (Table S2). We used Whatman 4 for all layers of our paper-based device and observed that signal formation starts at approximately 2 minutes. Products accumulate over time and cause an increase in signal intensity, until saturating at approximately 7 minutes after the sample was added (Figure 2A). Additionally, the gradual increase in signal intensity causes nearly linear broadening of the width of the formed interface over time, which eventually compromises signal intensity. Therefore, we determined the ideal signal read time is between 7-10 minutes, with the cut off time for signal interpretation to be 20 minutes. Prior to the cut off time, the signal intensity is at a maximum value and can be used for qualitative detection, which we demonstrate with Fe(III) ions (Figure 2B). Signal intensities at 2 minutes and 100 minutes resulted in similar intensity values (data not shown). Longer times lead to diminishing signal intensity due to diffusion of product.",

To detect Fe(III), we stored ascorbic acid (a reducing agent) and 3-(2-pyridyl)-5,6-diphenyl-1,2,4-triazine-p,p'-disulfonic acid (Ferrozine; a colorimetric indicator of Fe(II))[46] in opposite channels of the reagent storage layer (Figure 3A).

If Fe(III) is present in the sample, it will be reduced to Fe(II) in the channel containing ascorbic acid, while no reactions will occur in the channel containing Ferrozine. When the two wicking fronts converge at the detection zone on the bottom layer of the device, reduced Fe(II) is chelated by Ferrozine and forms a purple signal at the formed interface (Figure 3B, Figure S4).",

In one channel, we added a reducing agent called ascorbic acid. In the other channel, we added a colorimetric indicator called Ferrozine. When we put some of our sample in both channels, the Fe(III) in the sample gets changed into Fe(II) when it comes in contact with the reducing agent. But it doesn't have a reaction with Ferrozine right away because it's in a different channel. Then the two channels get pulled together by a special fabric.

This color, a reaction product with Ferrozine, could be caused by Fe(II) impurities in either the Fe(III) sample or the paper[47]. We minimized the background signal by incorporating ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in the Ferrozine side of the sample distribution layer[48]. We tested both the effect of different EDTA and Ferrozine concentrations on the signal to background ratio (Table S3, Table S4). As the concentration of Ferrozine increased, the intensities of both the signal formed at the readout zone and the background increased. The increase in background intensity did not negatively impact the signal to background ratio, which increased proportionally with the concentration of Ferrozine. However, the increase in signal to background ratio in the presence of EDTA was higher than that without using EDTA, which further suggests that the incorporation of EDTA provided superior results (Table S3, Table S4).",

AChE hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into choline and acetic acid to terminate neurotransmission at the cholinergic synapse. Inhibition of AChE by organophosphates, heavy metals, or chemical warfare agents can block acetylcholine transmission and lead to organ failure and death [50]. We chose AChE as a model analyte to evaluate how interfaces were formed when reactions were governed by two time-dependent processes: (i) the activity of the enzyme (i.e., the analyte) and (ii) diffusion and mixing of reactants across the interface. To detect AChE, we stored acetylcholine chloride and 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB, Ellman's reagent) on opposite sides of the reagent storage layer (Figure S6). When AChE is present in the added sample, it reacts with acetylcholine to produce acetic acid and thiocholine (Figure 4A). At the interface, the unmasked sulfhydryl group on the thiocholine interacts with DTNB to generate 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoic acid and form a yellow signal that we could quantify with image analysis. As expected for an enzymatic assay, the signal intensities saturated over time. Similar to the Fe(III) assay, signal from AChE assay took approximately two minutes to start forming and increased in width and intensity over time. To ensure color saturation, we used the scans taken 10 minutes after sample addition to analyze the signal intensity formed at the interface. We performed nonlinear regression of the data using a saturation growth model for concentrations of AChE ranging from 2-30 U/mL (Figure 4B). From the fit, we determined that there was a nearly linear relationship between the concentration of AChE and measured signal between 2-10 U/mL, and signals at higher concentrations were saturated and could be detected but not quantified. While the physiological range of AChE in plasma is greater than 8 U/mL [51], exposure to dangerous chemical agents (e.g., organophosphates) results in a reduction of AChE activity into the linear range of this assay. While it can be hard to detect yellow lines on white backgrounds with the naked eye, especially at lower analyte concentrations, this AChE assay remains useful to provide a visual reference for qualitative detection (i.e., \"yes or no\" presence of analyte).

To see if AChE is present, we use a yellow powder in our device. When AChE is added to the device, it reacts with acetylcholine and another kind of powder to make a yellow color that we can see. This happens over time and the yellow color gets bigger and stronger. We can measure how much AChE is there by counting the yellow color after it's been made for 10 minutes. If there is a lot of AChE, the yellow color is too strong and we can't tell for sure how much is there.

The high noise is likely due to both MTT and PMS reagents causing a yellow background color. Since the assay involves enzymatic reactions, we analyzed the results by nonlinear regression using a growth and saturation model. The data showed a nearly linear relationship between signal intensity (green channel) at concentrations of lactate less than 20 mM. At higher concentrations of lactate, the signal saturated and resulted in detectable but not quantifiable signal (Figure 5C).

Even so, the opportunity to integrate positive controls, which are frequently missing from assays developed for paper-based microfluidic devices, would address a major requirement for point-of-care tests. Beyond their use as procedural controls, we anticipate that the intensities of these lines may have the potential to be used as visual comparators to estimate the concentration of the analyte in the sample.

This choice allowed us to decouple the effects of acidity and coordination modulation and to evaluate the advantages of our approach over the already established use of HF. Whereas the increase of H\\({}_{3}\\)O\\({}^{*}\\) concentration has positive effects on the crystallinity in general, the -10 \\(\\upmu\\)m average crystal size observed by using HCI increases 4-fold with HF and 8-fold with oxalic acid (Figure 1a, Figures S3-S8), suggesting that the anion's coordinative capabilities have the most significant influence. However, in the case of fluoride modulation, the crystal size was not the only observed change as X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) patterns show the presence of a secondary phase (Figure 1b). This is supported by the appearance of a secondary combustion process in the thermogravimetric profiles (Figure S37). These differences agree with the formation of a fluorine-substituted form of MIL-53, Al(F)bdc, whose properties differ significantly from those of the fluorine-free material, especially concerning its renowned breathing behaviour[38].",

Using HCI made the average crystal size four times bigger than normal. Using HF made it eight times bigger. Using sodium oxalate didn't work. But using HF caused a new phase to appear, so we don't really like using it. The X-ray pattern showed a difference, too.

Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis on rinsed product obtained by HF-modulated synthesis shows that all the observed crystals are contaminated with fluoride inclusions (Figures 1c and S36). This evidence indicates that Al(F)bdc is present as crystalline domains within MIL-53 crystals rather than as a pure phase. This is further corroborated by the absence of structured diffuse scattering in high-resolution SCXRD data from contaminated crystals (Figures S54-S55)[40, 41]. Additionally, a minor fraction of the crystals exhibit a higher density of aluminium and fluorine, in line with the previously reported presence of undesired AlF\\({}_{3}\\) (Figure 1c, Figure S36, and Table S3)[32].

This means that Al(F)bdc isn't really a new thing, but instead is already in some of the MIL-53 crystals. Even the SCXRD data from the contaminated crystals didn't show any unique pattern for Al(F)bdc [Figures S54-S55]. Also, sometimes the Al(F)bdc has more Al and F than normal, which means there might be some AlF3 present as well.

These MOFs were synthesized using 0.5, 1, and 1.5 oxalic acid:Al ratios to study how the amount of modulator affects the crystallinity of the products. In all the studied systems, oxalic acid leads to an increased crystal size with respect to the unmodulated synthesis (Figure 2, Figures S9-S23). Interestingly, a higher modulator-to-Al ratio does not always result in improved crystallinity. Indeed, in the cases of OH- and CH\\({}_{3}\\)O-MIL-53, an excessive amount of modulator leads to the stabilisation of a specific size or the absence of solid products, respectively. This behaviour can be attributed to the electron-donor character of OH and CH\\({}_{3}\\)O groups[45], which lowers the acidity of terephthalatic acid by destabilising its conjugated base[46]. Additionally, the pH decrease due to the MOF synthesis and to the formation of aluminium oxalate complexes further disfavours the deprotonation of the linkers, thus diminishing their reactivity. Our results show that the combination of these effects can allow for the tuning of the product's size distribution, in addition to its crystallinity. However, to achieve such control several aspects should be considered, in particular the modulator concentration, the species formed during the synthesis, and the chemical properties of the linker. Therefore, the adequate conditions to stabilize a specific size must be optimised for every system.",

These signals are attributable to a local ordering of the NO\\({}_{2}\\) groups, which can be found disordered in four equivalent positions for every linker after the MOF assembly. The effect of the modulator in slowing the crystal growth can favour this ordering and allow the formation of larger ordered domains, which could grow clustered in polycrystalline aggregates like those observed by SEM for the products obtained with the highest modulator concentration. Further experiments to confirm this hypothesis and determine the ordering of the NO\\({}_{2}\\) groups will be the focus of our future research.",

We attribute this remarkable versatility to oxalic acid's synergistic action in both binding the metals and protonating the linkers, thus introducing a substantial control over the MOF nucleation and regulating the crystal growth. Furthermore, we described how the strong differences between its characteristic five-membered ring chelation and the linker's coordination mode in the studied materials allow the modulating function without causing substitutional defects. These advantages do not apply in the case of modulators whose coordination capabilities are compatible with those found in the IBUs, such as fluoride or monocarboxylate species.

Thus, for the \\(D_{4h}\\) structure, there is little change in the ground state orbital angular momentum upon fluctuations in the \\(b_{2u}\\) mode that provides a coordinate between the \\(D_{4h}\\) and \\(D_{2d}\\) structures. However, the excited state potential energy surface is offset from the ground state surface near the equilibrium position of the \\(D_{2d}\\) geometry, which allows for larger changes in ground state orbital angular momentum for the \\(a_{I}\\)_(1)_ mode.",
            "output_text": "Alright, for the big words, we can say that for the \\(D_{2d}\\) there is an extra thing happening. In the lowest mode, there is a stronger spin-phonon connection (called a \"b\" word), but for the \\(D_{2d}\\), a new lowest mode (called an \"a\" word) starts to be activated too. This is important for qubits at low temperatures because the new lowest mode can get filled up. All square planar copper qubits, which are in the literature, have this \\(D_{4h}\\) shape. By comparing the vibrational analyses of the lowest modes in \\(D_{2d}\\) and \\(D_{4h}\\), we can see that the spin-phonon coupling term is larger for the \\(D_{2d}\\). This happens because there is a bigger gradient in the excited state surfaces as we switch between these two structural shapes (called \"ground\" and \"excited\"), making it easier for fluctuations in the lowest mode (the new one for the \\(D_{2d}\\) version) to affect the ground state orbital angular momentum."

The \\(a_{I}\\)_(1)_ mode can be described by the Cl-Cu-Cl bond angle, \\(\\alpha\\), while the \\(a_{I}\\)_(2)_ mode can be described by the Cu-Cl bond distance. Effective decoherence maps have been generated spanning this space of [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- geometries (Figure 6 (a-c)). In Figure 6, the magnitude and direction of g\\({}_{x}\\)-value gradients (i.e., effective linear spin-phonon coupling terms in this space) are represented by the size and directions of the arrows on the plot. The horizontal and vertical components of the arrows reflect the relative contributions to the \\(a_{I}\\)_(2)_ and \\(a_{I}\\)_(1)_ modes, respectively. It is evident from this representation that, for the \\(D_{4h}\\) structure, the gradient in g\\({}_{x}\\)-value is small for any linear combination of these two structural coordinates. However, upon increasing the angle, \\(\\alpha\\), the gradient in g\\({}_{x}\\) systematically increases.

This map is expected to translate to any four coordinate Cu(II) complex. Indeed, previous EPR experiments on a large scope of Cu(II) complexes have concluded that spin relaxation rates are faster for tetrahedrally-distorted geometries vs. square planar geometries [69]. This observation is fully supported by extension of the model derived here (seeFigure S19).The 2D maps are also presented for spin density and the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{2g}\\)/\\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{1}\\) ligand field transition energies, wherein the trends in both cases track with expressions in Section 2.1.",

            "input_text": "Above, we have outlined a general LFT model of spin-phonon coupling terms in S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) transition metal complexes. This model is derived from the first and second derivatives of the LFT expressions of g-values given in Section 2.1[54]. While these expressions define the zero temperature magnitudes of spin-phonon coupling terms in S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) complexes, they can be expanded to consider additional dynamic effects through the variance of g\\({}_{z}\\), \\(\\langle g_{z}^{2}\\rangle\\), which highlights the importance of the first derivative, \\(\\frac{\\partial g_{z}}{\\partial q_{l}}\\), and therefore its role in the coherence lifetimes of S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) transition metal complexes. This suggests that, without considering thermal population, odd modes such as totally symmetric stretches will have a more substantial effect on spin-phonon coupling terms and decoherence compared to even modes, in which their value of relevance, \\(\\frac{\\partial^{2}g_{z}}{\\partial q_{l}^{2}}\\), only appears in the second order term of the Taylor expansion (equation 5). The fundamental behavior of these expressions were borne out by an extensive range of DFT and TD-DFT calculations on minimalistic S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) models, \\(D_{4h}\\)/\\(D_{2d}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- and \\(C_{\\mathcal{H}}\\) [VOCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)-. Together, the results above provide a general description of the roles of transition metal geometric and electronic structure in spin-phonon coupling. For instance, the magnitudes of spin-phonon coupling terms are strongly influenced by excited state SOC of orbital angular momentum into the ground state and are predicted to be strongly influenced by the energy of the particular ligand field excited state mixing with the ground state (equations 6 and 7) (e.g., \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{2g}\\) for a \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{1g}\\) ground state in \\(D_{4h}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)-). This excited state SOC contribution is governed by the ligand field geometry about the metal complex. For example, going from \\(D_{4h}\\) to \\(D_{2d}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- turns on additional mode coupling terms due to the enhancement of excited state coupling terms (Figure 4). Furthermore, the magnitude of spin-phonon coupling terms are strongly influenced by the covalency of ligand-metal bonds. This dynamic effect largely reflects a relativistic nephelauxetic effect, which effectively modulates the SOC constant of the metal from that of the free ion. In short, the more covalent the ligand-metal bond, the smaller the spin-phonon coupling terms become. Relatedly, a significant overall reduction in SOC constant can of course be achieved through the use of different transition metal complexes (e.g., V(IV) vs. Cu(II) vs. Cr(V)). As shown below, V(IV), which has a significantly lower SOC constant than Cu(II), can still maintain favorable spin-phonon coupling terms despite having significantly more ionic ligand-metal bonds than Cu(II) complexes. Complications can also arise from trying to quantify spin-phonon coupling terms in different ligand field environments, as the nature of the modes can change. However, this can be facilitated to some degree by leveraging specific group theoretical correlations as demonstrated here for \\(D_{4h}\\), \\(D_{2d}\\), and \\(C_{\\mathcal{H}}\\) transition metal complexes. The spin-phonon analyses presented above for [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- and [VOCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- are now extended to a range of S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) Cu(II) and V(IV) molecular qubit candidates.",

So, modes that make the spins move a lot (like totally symmetric stretches) have a bigger effect on spin-phonon coupling and coherence lifetimes.

Very recently, Albino et al.[13] pointed to the role of increased excited state SOC in six coordinate complexes relative to vandyl complexes. Furthermore, Fataftah et al.[33] compared six coordinate V(IV) complexes to Cu(II) complexes to suggest the role of increased covalency in elongating \\(T_{I}\\) relaxation lifetimes. Here we have extended our LFT model to the V(bdt)\\({}_{3}\\) and V(bds)\\({}_{3}\\) complexes studied by Fataftah et al.[33] (Table 6). Interestingly, as pointed out by Albino et al.[13] for other six coordinate V(IV) complexes, the V(bdt)\\({}_{3}\\) and V(bds)\\({}_{3}\\) complexes exhibit very low energy calculated ligand field transitions (7935 and 6785 cm-1, respectively). Furthermore, the totally symmetric stretches of these complexes were computed at 351.7 and 209.8 cm-1, respectively.

Thus, the longer spin-lattice relaxation time at higher temperatures for Cu(bdt)\\({}_{2}\\) vs. V(bdt)\\({}_{3}\\) is not due to differences in ligand-metal covalency, but rather stems from efficient excited state SOC as a result of the relatively low energy ligand field transition energies for V(bdt)\\({}_{3}\\). This is further supported by the observation of room temperature coherence in vandylcomplexes,[37] despite ionic ligand metal bonding.

Factors 1) and 3) are directly related, as covalency further reduces the SOC constant of a metal in a complex relative to that of the free ion. LFT expressions derived here predict spin-phonon coupling terms in both odd and even modes are important to consider for decoherence times (equation 5). However, odd modes such as the totally symmetric stretch play a key role for decoherence times. We have further shown how the LFT expressions and thus spin-phonon coupling terms (equations 6 and 7) can be directly related to spectroscopic observables and calculable quantities. For Cu(II), key geometric and symmetry factors, including ligand field strain, significantly lower excited state coupling terms while simultaneously increasing orbital overlap and ligand-metal covalency. Importantly, all factors relating to excited state SOC and covalency need to be evaluated when comparing spin-phonon coupling terms, including local mode contributions to \\(T_{I}\\) and \\(T_{m}\\) relaxation times, of various metal complexes.

We designed benzo-annulated aza[n]helicenes, which benefit from both the suppressed elevation of HOMO energies and high solubility due to hydrogen-bonding with solvent molecules to overcome these challenges. This strategy enabled the synthesis of six new aza[n]helicenes ([n]AHs) of different lengths (n = 9-19) from acyclic precursors via one-shot oxidative fusion reactions. The structures of all the synthesized aza[n]helicenes were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, and their electrochemical potentials were measured by cyclic voltammetry.

The noncovalent interaction (NCI) plots confirm the existence of an effective n-n interaction between the layers. The absorption and fluorescence spectra red-shifted as the helical lengths increased, without any distinct saturation points.

            "input_text": "Helicene is a class of chiral n-conjugated molecules with a screw-shaped skeleton formed by _ortho_-fused benzene rings (_i.e._, phenanthrene units) that has been actively studied.[1] In addition to the chiroptical properties such as circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL),[2] their physical properties as molecular springs[3] and the CISS effect[4] are cutting-edge functionalities based on the helical molecular scaffold. When focusing on the lengths of [n]carbholeicenes, it is assumed that the overlap of the n-planes becomes more significant by forming a layered structure; double layered at n = 7 and triple layered at n = 13. In 2015, [16]carbobielcene (A) was synthesized by Murase and Fujita, and this is the longest [n]carbobielcene ever synthesized (Figure 1).[5] The synthesis of longer helicenes has been desired simply as a synthetic challenge and various improved synthetic methods have been devised.[1-6] Helicenes comprising more than triple-layered structures are particularly difficult to synthesize, because of solubility issues, and because the middle-layered core is tightly compressed, making it difficult to release the strain. Recently, several longer helicene analogues that can release the strain by virtue of their structure have been developed. For example, expanded helicenes, in which phenanthrene units are partially replaced by anthracine units to increase the diameter of helicenes,[6] and perylene bisimide-incorporated helicenes (helicene nanoribbons) have been synthesized.[7] These \"diameter-expanded\" helicene analogues display interesting dynamic behavior and chiroptical properties. Tilly's group synthesized expanded [n]helicenes (B) with three different lengths (n = 15, 19, 23), and compared the racemization barriers and dissymmetry factors.[8] By contrast, Hirose and Matsuda have reported \"n-extended\" [n]carbobielcenes (C) with three different lengths (n = 5, 7, 9), and compared their chiroptical properties, aromaticity, and ultrafast dynamics in the excited state.[9] As another type of helicene analog, heterobielcenes, in which heteroatoms are embedded into the helicene backbones, have also attracted attention because of their excellent luminescence and redox properties.[10; 11] Generally, heterohelicenes are more electron-rich compared with carbobielcenes, thus their HOMO energy levels are continuously destabilized with the n-extension. Therefore, it is more difficult to synthesize longer heterohelicenes with full conjugation, whereas several heterohelicenes with a double-layered structure have been synthesized; one example is diazatri-oxa-[13]helicene D.[12] Furthermore, a triple-layered structure was accomplished with oxa[n]helicene E (n = 17, 19) albeit with disrupted n-conjugation.[13] To qualitatively evaluate the electronic properties of helicenes, however, it is necessary to systematically synthesize fully conjugated heterohelicenes of different lengths, therefore, a synthetic strategy toward longer heterohelicene would be indispensable. Currently, few systematic synthetic methods are available for the synthesis of heterohelicenes.",

When scientists studied it, they were very interested in its special qualities. Some of these qualities include turning light left or right, spring-like properties, and something called the CISS effect. When they wanted to study the molecule more, they wanted to make a longer one. However, making bigger helicenes is hard because they have problems with being in water and being too squeezed in the middle. To solve this problem, scientists made different kinds of helicenes that had extra parts or different rings in the middle. Some of these helicenes can be bigger because they have wider rings or are stretched out. Scientists want to study these longer helicenes because they can learn more about their electric properties. Unfortunately, most helicenes cannot be made fully conjugated, so scientists are trying to figure out how to make longer fully conjugated helicenes with heteroatoms (like oxygen or nitrogen). But it's very difficult to do this because disruptions in the n-conjugation are expected to occur with increased chain length. To make longer fully conjugated heterohe"

Fortunately, single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis were obtained by slow vapor diffusion of _n_-hexane into solutions of [n]AHs in THF, acetone, or 1,4-dioxane. The structures are shown in Figure 2A in which the solvent molecules coordinated to the NH moiety via hydrogen bonds are omitted. Because of the sophisticated molecular design, intermolecular interactions between [n]AHs were not observed in any of the structures, thereby contributing good solubility. Indeed, five and seven acetone molecules were included in the asymmetric units of [13]AH and [15]AH, respectively, (Figures S5-4, 5-5) whereas seven 1,4-dioxane molecules were included in the asymmetric unit of [19]AH (Figure S5-7). For [9]AH, the vertical distance (interplanar distance) between the centroid of terminal benzene ring A and the mean plain of the opposite terminal benzene ring I is 3.807 A. As the typical distance of \\(\\pi\\)-stacking is approximately 3.4 A, interlayer interaction between the terminal benzene rings may be minimal, similarly to that of [7]carbobilecene (3.8-3.9 A).[20] The interplanar angle between the stacked two benzene rings is approximately 40\\({}^{\\circ}\\), which also suggests that the interlayer \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interaction is weak. By contrast, for [11]AH, the longest and shortest vertical distances are 3.567 A and 3.202 A, respectively, suggesting a distinct interlayer \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interaction between the stacked aromatic rings. The interplanar angles are 16.3\\({}^{\\circ}\\), 11.6\\({}^{\\circ}\\), and 20.4\\({}^{\\circ}\\), being smaller than that of [9]AH in accordance with the effective interlayer \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions. The crystal structures of [13]AH and [15]AH are also shown in Figure 2A. As the space group is _P3\\({}_{2}\\)_ for the former and the lattice contains only one enantiomer, spontaneous chiral resolution took place for [13]AH upon crystallization. Chiral separation using HPLC apparatus is discussed later. In [13]AH and [15]AH, the shortest interplanar distances are less than 3.2 A (3.199 A and 3.176 A), and the aromatic rings are very closely packed together, again confirming the existence of effective \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions. The smallest interplanar angles are 3.3\\({}^{\\circ}\\) and 1.4\\({}^{\\circ}\\) for [13]AH and [15]AH, respectively. These values are even smaller than those of [11]AH. The crystal structures of [17]AH and [19]AH are the first examples of triple-layered fully conjugated heterobilenes. In both [17]AH and [19]AH, the shortest interplanar distances are also less than 3.2 A (3.170 A and 3.185 A, respectively), and the smallest interplanar angles are the smallest of those measured (1.2\\({}^{\\circ}\\) and 0.8\\({}^{\\circ}\\)). The interplanar angles at the ends are larger than those of the helicene central core due to the effect of electron repulsion and smaller steric constraints ([19]AH; \\(\\theta_{\\rm{A}}\\) = 19.5\\({}^{\\circ}\\), \\(\\theta_{\\rm{BN}}\\) = 0.81\\({}^{\\circ}\\)). However, at the center of the helicene core, the angles are almost 0\\({}^{\\circ}\\), because the central layers of [17]AH and [19]AH are located under large steric constraints from the top and bottom layers. After six types of crystal structures were obtained, their structural parameters of them (interplanar distance, interplanar angle, and dihedral angle) were compared with those of the obtained structures calculated at the B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-SVP level (Fig 2B).[21, 22] For all the parameters, the trend of the experimentally determined values agreed with those obtained from the theoretical calculations, which reproduced the notable changes from [9]AH to [11]AH. This result reflects the weak intramolecular \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions at the terminal aromatic ring of helicenes. A decrease in the interplanar distances or angles results in an increase in the dihedral angles, indicating that the intramolecular interactions become stronger and the aromatic rings become more densely stacked with helicene elongation, while the strain energies of the [n]AHs increase with helicene elongation. To estimate the inherent strain energy of [n]AHs, we attempted to adopt a homodesmotic reaction model.[23] Accordingly, the strain energy (_AH_) of [n]AHs increased continuously as the number _n'_ increased (Figure S7-12). These estimations are in accordance with several cases of expanded helicenes previously reported.[60] Finally, the interlayer \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions of [n]AHs between the two neighboring layers were visualized using the noncovalent interaction (NCI) plot analysis (Figures 2A and S7-11).[24] Dispersion interactions between the two stacked layers of [n]AHs are obvious (green surface shows intramolecular \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions). In particular, intramolecular \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions across three layers was confirmed for [17]AH and [19]AH.",

Notably, the benzo segments (rings 6 and 7 for [9]AH and rings 7 and 8 for [11]AH) exhibit relatively deshielded features compared with the neighboring six-membered ring. The anisotropy of the induced current density (ACID) calculations [20] revealed the localized aromatic ring-current flows of the pyrrole and the annulated benzene rings in [9]AH and [11]AH as the dominant contributions (Figure 4B). These results represented Clar's sextet rule as shown in Figure 4C. Such local aromaticity suppresses the increase in the HOMO energy levels to the extent that the isolation of these molecules without any kinetically stabilizing substituents is allowed under air. The same calculations were performed for longer [n]AH and the same trend in their aromaticity was observed (Figures S7-9, S7-10).",

The structures of all synthesized azah helicenes were determined using XRD analysis. [17]AH and [19]AH are the first heteropticleines with a triple-layered helix. The structural parameters of the helicenes (_i.e._, interplanar distance, interplanar angle, and torsion angle) were compared experimentally and theoretically. The intramolecular interactions became stronger and the aromatic rings became more densely stacked with the elongation of the helical structure. The NCI plots confirmed the existence of an effective \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interaction between the layers. Electrochemical potentials were measured using CV, and the first oxidation potential shifted to the negative side in response to helicene elongation. The absorption and fluorescence spectra red-shifted as the helical lengths increased, without any distinct saturation points. The optical resolutions of _N_-butylated [9]AH and [11]AH were accomplished, and their CD and CPL spectra were measured.

As part of this work, we curate a diverse database of over 400 reference species from the available literature for use in fitting BACs or to participate in IDRs, and also provide AECs and BACs for 15 commonly used levels of theory using the workflow implemented. When comparing the approaches, we find that both BAC types yield results of similar accuracy, though the Anantharaman and Melius-type BACs seem to generalize better. Further, although the IDRs approach is often as accurate as the BAC approaches and sometimes even more advantageous, we find that this method appears to be less robust than the BAC methods.

One way to do this is to calculate something called atomization energy correction (AEC) and then add something called bond additivity correction (BAC).

However, to realize the accuracy gains, it is well-known that energy corrections are needed in addition to the QM calculations to reduce residual errors present from the given level of theory (LOT). Usually, atomization energy corrections (AECs) are needed to correct for the large systematic errors in the computed absolute energies of atoms, and to connect the computed zero of energy to the standard state zero of energy used when defining the enthalpy of formation (a.k.a. heats of formation) \\(\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{f}}\\). As we show later in this work, if no additional corrections are used, the resulting \\(\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{f}}\\) tends to have a fairly wide distribution of errors, often not centered around zero. The need for additional corrections is well-known, and in fact, such corrections have already been derived for some DLPNO methods [5].",

But to be accurate, we need to add more numbers to make it right. These numbers are called atomization energy corrections (AECs) and they help to connect the energy from our calculations to the standard state zero of energy. Without these corrections, the \\(\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{f}}\\) can have a lot of errors and is not always close to zero. There are already AECs for some DLPNO methods, but more are needed."

Recently, delta machine learning (\\(\\Delta\\)-ML) techniques have been applied to this type of problem [6]. However, while ML methods have gained popularity, they often lack the interpretability intrinsic to classic strategies. In this study, our emphasis will be placed on two conventional methods. The first approach involves the use of bond additivity corrections (BACs). BAC methods assume that the residual error from QM calculations can be attributed to errors associated with specific types of bonds within a molecule. Further, the errors associated with a particular type of bond (e.g., a C-C single bond) are assumed to be largely consistent across various molecules that contain the same bond type. Therefore, a correction value can be fitted for each bond type found in a collection of reference molecules, and the total bond additivity correction is simply the sum of these corrections for every bond in a species of interest. In this work, we focus on two popular implementations of BAC: those of Petersson et al. [7] and those of Anantharaman and Melius [8]. For brevity, below we call the Anantharaman & Melius' BAC's \"Melius-type\" or \"m-BAC\", although we note that Melius had success with several different types of BACs during his long career [9]. Similarly, we will denote Petersson's BAC as \"Petersson-type\" or \"p-BAC\".",

One classic method is called bond additivity corrections (BACs). BACs guess the errors associated with certain kinds of bonds are pretty much the same for all molecules that have them. So, you can add up the corrections for every BAC in a molecule to get a correction for the energy. Two popular ways to do BACs are called Melius-type or m-BAC, and Petersson-type or p-BAC."

The IDRs approach has the advantage of being insensitive to the AECs since they cancel out when computing heats of reaction. The IDRs approach has been used to calculate accurate enthalpy of formation for large molecules such as C\\({}_{60}\\) and corannulene [12]. Recent breakthroughs have been made in this avenue, with the work of Buerger et al. [13] showing how isodesmic reactions can be found systematically and automatically rather than designing them by hand as has been done traditionally. This advancement allows IDRs to be used in high-throughput calculations when implemented in statistical mechanics or thermochemistry software.",

In this method, more species are involved in the reaction, but the species we want to get information about (called the target species) is the same size.

The IDRs method is good because it doesn't care about how different molecules are from each other, and it can be used to calculate enthalpy of formation for big molecules like C\\({}_{60}\\) and corannulene.

If all the other species in our reaction have the same kind of atoms and bonds, these mistakes cancel each other out. However, since we don't count the target molecule in equation 5d, the mistakes related to its atoms and bonds remain. That's why the sum in equation 5d calculates corrections like the AECs and BACs for the chemical features present in the target molecule. So, if someone creates isodesmic reactions by focusing on certain kinds of bonds as proposed by Petersson, then the idea behind IDRs is mathematically the same as using Petersson-type BACs, but with a smaller set since fewer species are selected for calculations."

As mentioned previously, isodesmic reactions essentially use a much smaller training set to apply what are essentially another form of BACs. One disadvantage is that if a reference species included in the isodesmic reaction has a large uncharacteristic error, this error will affect the final result much more than if a larger reference set was used for training. One way to mitigate this error sensitivity issue is to take an average or median of values obtained from multiple isodesmic reactions. Another method to allow better error cancellation is to choose species that are chemically similar to the target when building IDRs. Finally, constraints could be placed on the species of an isodesmic reaction to ensure that the bonds present in the reaction are similar in nature to each other, and thus should have similar cancellation of errors. These constraints have been employed in the literature, and we adapt them for our workflow.",

Sometimes it's harder to get the right answer from an IDR because if there is one wrong number, it can affect the result more than if a bigger booklet was used to train. To help fix this, sometimes you can take the average or middle number. If you want to make better IDRs, you can pick numbers that are similar to the ones you want to measure. And sometimes you can put rules in place to make sure that only similar numbers are used. These rules have been used before for other tests, and we use them for our experiments, too."

The next reaction class, RC3, adds the further restriction that the coordinationnumber for each atom on both sides of a bond must also be conserved. The coordination number for the atoms connected by the bond is then used to define a bond feature that separates different types of bonds. Take single C-C bond of ethane as an example, where the carbon atoms on two sides of this bond both have a coordination number of 3 (notice that by convention the carbon-carbon bond in question is excluded from the calculation of coordination number). However, for the single C-C bond in propylene, the \\(sp^{3}\\) carbon atom has a coordination number of 3 but the other \\(sp^{2}\\) carbon atom only has a coordination number of 2. Therefore, the C-C single bond of ethane and propylene are treated as different bond types. Finally, RC4 adds the further constraint that the identity of the neighboring atoms (i.e. atoms who are also bonded to at least one of the atoms in the original bond in question), as well as their own coordination numbers must also be conserved.

RC3 adds another constraint, so that the number of parts for each atom around a specific bond is conserved.

Given that charged species are more likely to have significant errors from QM calculations, it would be better to bias the algorithm to choose neutrals as reference species when possible, especially for neutral targets. To solve this issue, we added the charged-constrained sub-class, which limits included species to have a formal charge no more anionic or cationic than what is present in the target species.

The distribution of errors appears to be wider, and there appear to be more outlier values for isodesmic reactions. Therefore, considering the increased error, coupled with the fact that many species cannot be easily calculated using IDR, the automatic IDR fitting method described so far does not seem advantageous. Yet, we think there are potential remedies that merit further exploration.",
            "output_text": "The diagram in Figure 7 shows that most species in the reference set cannot be calculated using big class reactions like RC4. It's not fair to compare the errors in RC4 reactions to RC2 or RC3 because they are measuring different things. The reference species may have more easy-to-calculate species, which would make it harder to see how accurate RC4 is. The errors seen in isodesmic reactions seem bigger than those in the BAC approach, and there are more extreme errors. However, the problem with using isodesmic reactions for IDR is that they aren't helpful for calculating many species. Nonetheless, we think that it's still worth exploring solutions to these issues."

For instance, one aspect that is worth considering is the data quality of the species included in the isodesmic reaction since some species in the reference set might have a poor geometry at the given level of theory. Buerger et al. were aware of this issue and their solution was to perform a careful prunning of the reference set to remove species that seemed to be inconsistent with the rest of the reference set because these species were considered to have high chances of yielding large error.",

For each reference species, we check the difference between the known heat of formation and the heat of formation calculated using AECs. Then, we make a list of reference species that fit well with the given LOT and follow the rules of the reaction class.
