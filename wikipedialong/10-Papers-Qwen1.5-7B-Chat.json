Stoichiometric reactions of the solvated nickel complexes reveal that \"ligandless\" nickel is exceptionally capable of serving as reservoir of CF\\({}_{3}\\) anions or radicals under catalytically relevant conditions. ## Introduction Nickel is a promising platform for developing practical fluoroalkylation methodologies as fundamental steps relevant to chemical bond forming reactions have been established. Reductive eliminations involving fluoroalkyl groups have been demonstrated at higher valent states of nickel,[1, 2, 3, 4] the generation of fluoroalkyl radicals via electron transfer or atom abstraction reactions of fluoroalkyl electrophiles with nickel is known,[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] fluoroalkyl-based transmetalating reagents readily react with nickel,[13, 14, 15] and catalytic transformations involving select fluoroalkyl groups have been reported.[16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 10, 22, 6] Nickel is also an earth-abundant metal with a reasonably low cost. However, most of the aforementioned chemical transformations involving fluoroalkyl groups required nickel to bear stabilizing ligands other than solvent. While in many cases ligands can serve to tune and enable the reactivity of a nickel center, in other cases they can prevent catalysis through redistributions that affect the speciation of an active form of the nickel catalyst. Moreover, extraneous non-solvento ligands raise the cost of a chemical process and can even contribute to the air-sensitivity of the system. Given these considerations, we became interested in developing new fluoroalkylation methods with nickel that employed solvent as theonly coordinating ligand. Such reaction conditions have commonly been referred to as \"ligandless\" conditions in other systems.[22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28] Previously, we found that [PPh\\({}_{4}\\)]**2** and [PPh\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}_{3}\\)**(Chart 1) could be synthesized by the addition of one and two equivalents of \"AgCF\\({}_{3}\\)\" to **1** in the presence of [PPh\\({}_{4}\\)]Cl.[29] The electronic properties of **2** and **3** were extensively studied through the use of density functional theory (DFT) calculations, spectroscopy-oriented configuration interaction (SORCI) calculations, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry.[29] Interestingly, the data collectively show that **2** and **3** are better described as physically \\(d^{6}\\) metal complexes with the additional hole delocalized over the multiple trifluoromethyl ligands. The \"ligandless\" complexes **2** and **3** also displayed preliminary reactivities that warranted follow-up investigations. For example, **2** was found to react with an aryl iodonium salt to yield trifluoromethylated arene, presumably through a high-valent, unsupported and formally nickel(IV) intermediate. Evidence that such architectures are accessible was provided by the synthesis and structural characterization of [PPh\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}_{2}\\)[Ni(CF\\({}_{3}\\))\\({}_{4}\\)(SO\\({}_{4}\\))] (**4**, Chart 1), the first example of a \"ligandless\" trifluoromethyl nickel(IV) complex.[29] The high-valent complex **4**, while it could be crystallized, was rather unstable in solution. The instability of high-valent solvento complexes was also evident in electrochemical experiments, where **2** and **3** displayed irreversible oxidations on the timescale of the cyclic voltammogram. We believed this redox instability could be beneficial in terms of catalysis, where high-valent intermediates would need to irreversibly form chemical bonds or release perfluoroalkyl radicals for chemistries that turn over. Therefore, we sought to investigate further the oxidative chemistries of **2** and **3** and compare the reactivities to those of a perfluoroethyl analogue. **Results and Discussion** We have shown previously that [PPh\\({}_{4}\\)] salts of **2** and **3** (Chart 1) were susceptible to side reactions involving organic nucleophiles and the phosphorus moiety,[29] so herein we describe the preparation of tetramethylammonium salts of **2**, **3**, and the new perfluoroethyl derivative **5** (Scheme 1). Such compounds were easily prepared by the addition of \"Ag-R/\" to [(dme)NiBr\\({}_{2}\\)] in acetonitrile solvent in the presence of [NMe\\({}_{4}\\)]Cl. The \\({}^{19}\\)F NMR spectrum of **5** displays four signals with integrations consistent with two perfluoroethyl groups cis to the acetonitrile group and one perfluoroethyl group that is trans to the acetonitrile. The CF\\({}_{3}\\) resonance that is _trans_ to the coordinated acetonitrile appears as a quintet from the \\({}^{4}\\)J\\({}_{\\rm FF}\\) coupling of the other two CF\\({}_{2}\\) groups, while the resonance for the CF\\({}_{3}\\) groups that are _cis_ to the acetonitrile appear as a triplet. The absence of \\({}^{3}\\)J\\({}_{\\rm FF}\\) coupling is common for perfluoroalkyl groups and is suggested to arise from the rotational averaging of coupling constants of opposite sign between the vicinal CF\\({}_{2}\\) and CF\\({}_{3}\\) groups.[30, 31, 32, 33]The electrochemical properties of the newly prepared anionic complex **5** were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (Figure 2). The oxidation of **5** is irreversible and occurs at an onset potential of +0.21 V vs the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple. Peak potentials for **5** appear at +0.60 V and +1.26 V, which are slightly more positive than peaks observed for the trifluoromethyl derivative **2**[29]. Interestingly, the peak potential for the second redox event occurs at the same potential as the oxidation for the charge neutral bisperfluoroethyl complex **7** (Figure 2), consistent with the notion that upon oxidation to the nickel(III) species **6**, a perfluoroethyl radical is lost which generates **7** during the timescale of the experiment (eq **1**). Similar redox trends were found for the trifluoromethyl derivatives [(MeCN)Ni(CF\\({}_{3}\\))\\({}_{3}\\)]- **(2**) and [(MeCN)\\({}_{2}\\)Ni(CF\\({}_{3}\\))\\({}_{2}\\)] **(1)**[29], suggesting that while the higher oxidation states of solvated nickel fluoroalkyl complexes can be easily accessed via oxidation of anionic complexes such as **2** and **5**, the higher valent complexes have limited stabilities. Given the accessible oxidations available to the solvated nickel fluoroalkyl complexes, we explored their reactivity with various oxidizing electrophiles. The reactivity of the tris-perfluoroalkyl nickelates with iodonium salts is summarized in Scheme 2. Quite different reactivities were observed depending on the iodonium salt used. Reaction with the alkylynyl benziodoxolone reagent **8** (Scheme 2, eq 2) led to fluoroalkylated products (56% for CF\\({}_{3}\\) and 54% for C\\({}_{2}\\)F\\({}_{5}\\)). In the case of trifluoromethyl, [(MeCN)\\({}_{2}\\)Ni(CF\\({}_{3}\\))\\({}_{2}\\)] was determined to be the major identifiable nickel species after reaction was complete. Reactions that occurred with bis(4-tert-butylphenyl)iodonium hexafluorophosphate are shown in Scheme 2, eq 3. Interestingly, even though more elevated temperatures were required, the byproducts [(MeCN)\\({}_{2}\\)Ni(CF\\({}_{3}\\))\\({}_{2}\\)] and [(MeCN)\\({}_{2}\\)Ni(C\\({}_{2}\\)F\\({}_{5}\\))\\({}_{2}\\)] could be observed in higher quantities than the reactions described in eq 2. Next, we explored reactions of the tris-perfluoroalkyl nickelates with diazonium salts, and the results are provided in Scheme 3. Reactions with the diazonium salts occurred more rapidly than the iodonium salts, and starting material was consumed after 15 minutes. Fluoroalkylated arenes were formed in fair to good yields (41 - 70%), and similar reactivities were observed for both electron donating and withdrawing substituents (Scheme 3). Along with the fluorinated arenes, the bis(perfluoroalkyl)nickel byproducts were also observed in yields ranging from 30 - 62%. Diazonium compounds, like iodonium salts, are known to act as two-electron oxidants, and it is plausible that, in both systems explored in Schemes 2 and 3, a high-valent species like [Ar-Ni(R\\({}_{l}\\))\\({}_{3}\\)(MeCN)\\({}_{2}\\)] is involved in reductive eliminations that produces both fluoroalkylated arene and [(MeCN)\\({}_{2}\\)Ni(R\\({}_{l}\\))\\({}_{2}\\)] co-products. While we were unable to identify a charge-neutral and high valent [Ar-Ni(R\\({}_{l}\\))\\({}_{3}\\)(MeCN)\\({}_{2}\\)] species, we show here that we can identify the related solvated species [Ni(CF\\({}_{3}\\))\\({}_{4}\\)(MeCN)\\({}_{2}\\)] (**9**) upon chemical oxidation of [Ni(CF\\({}_{3}\\))\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2-}\\). Reaction of [Ni(CF\\({}_{3}\\))\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2-}\\) with two equivalents of Magic Blue oxidant led to **9** in 53% yield by \\({}^{19}\\)F NMR spectroscopy (eq 4) and in 30% isolated yield. As there are two types of trifluoromethyl groups in complex **9** (_trans_ to a MeCN and _trans_ to another CF\\({}_{3}\\)), complex **9** exhibited two septets in the \\({}^{19}\\)F NMR spectrum in acetonitrile (6 -19.2 (\\(J\\) = 7.2 Hz) and -30.7 (sept, \\(J\\) = 7.2 Hz). X-ray quality crystals could be grown from ether/pentane at low temperature, and an ORTEP diagram of **9** is shown in Figure 1. The trifluoromethyl groups that are trans to each other exhibit nickel-carbon distances of 2.0298(19) A, while the trifluoromethyl groups that are trans to acetonitrile ligands were shorter at 1.9569(17) A. This is consistent with the known trans influencing properties of the trifluoromethyl group. The nickel-carbon bond lengths of octahedral **9** in the formal +4 oxidation state were significantly longer than the average nickel(II)-carbon bond lengths in **3** (1.930(8) A)[29], which adopts a distorted square planar arrangement in the formal +2 oxidation state and also possesses four trifluoromethyl ligands. To our knowledge, **9** represents only the second formally nickel(IV) complex reported bearing four trifluoromethyl ligands[29]. **Scheme 3. Reaction of [NMe\\({}_{4}\\)][(MeCN)Ni(R\\({}_{J}\\))\\({}_{3}\\)] with select diazonium salts. Yields were determined by \\({}^{13}\\)F NMR spectroscopy relative to an internal standard.**Figure 1: ORTEP diagram of **9**. Ellipsoids shown at the 40% level. Selected bond lengths (Å): Ni1-C1 1.9569(17); Ni1-C2 2.0298(19); Ni1-N1 1.9682(15). Selected bond angles (”): C1-Ni1-N1 174.35(7); C1-Ni1-N1A 91.62(7); N1-Ni1-N1A 85.54(8); C1-Ni1-C2 93.32(8); Ni-Ni1C2A 87.55(7). Because the cyclic voltammograms of the anionic fluoroalkyl complexes of nickel revealed evidence of nickel-carbon bond homolyses reactions, we also examined the ability of solvated nickel complexes to perform Minisci-like C-H bond trifluoromethylations. In 2016, Wang reported the first example of a nickel-catalyzed C-H trifluoromethylation of electron-rich heteroarenes using iodotrifluoromethane as the CF\\({}_{3}\\) source and [(dppp)NiCl\\({}_{2}\\)] as the nickel source (dppp = 1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane).[6] In 2019, Sanford reported that the high-valent [TpNi(CF\\({}_{3}\\))\\({}_{3}\\)] (**10**, Tp = tris(pyrazol)]borate) could also mediate catalytic C-H trifluoromethylations of (hetero)arenes in the presence of Umemoto's Reagent II (**11**).[17] Mechanistic investigations of this process, both experimental and computational, suggested that the reactions proceeded through radical chain pathways involving nickel in variable oxidation states.[17] Since our \"ligandless\" nickel system could shuttle between the formally +2 to +4 oxidation states, we explored the possibility of using these complexes in similar C-H trifluoromethylations, as eliminating the need for extraneous supporting ligands would represent a significant advance in practicality. Table 1 summarizes the catalyst screens for the C-H trifluoromethylation reaction outlined in eq 5 that are based on the conditions identified by Sanford. Gratifyingly, the solvated complex **2** and the \"ligandless\" complex **3** catalyzed the trifluoromethylation of **1**,3,5-trimethoxybenzene by Umemoto II reagent (eq 5) in 78 and 96% yields, respectively, providing the first proof-in-principle that the solvated nickel complexes can perform catalytic trifluoromethylations. Notably, [NMe\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}_{2}\\)[Ni(CF\\({}_{3}\\))\\({}_{4}\\)] (**3**) performed just as well as [(Tp)Ni(CF\\({}_{3}\\))\\({}_{3}\\)] (**10**) under these conditions, which was reported to afford product in 93% yield.[17] To test the effect of metal identity on the C-H trifluoromethylations, a reaction with the recently prepared [(MeCN)\\({}_{3}\\)Co(CF\\({}_{3}\\))\\({}_{3}\\)] (**12**)[34] was examined (entry 5). Complex **12**, while displaying catalytic turnover, afforded yields that were lower than nickel. With the optimal catalyst identified as [NMe\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}_{2}\\)[Ni(CF\\({}_{3}\\))\\({}_{4}\\)] in Table 1, we then determined the scope of the catalytic C-H trifluoromethylations (Scheme 4). trifluoromethylations of electron rich arenes **13a-13c** proceeded smoothly, however introduction of an aldehyde into the aromatic scaffold (**13d**) lowered the yield of trifluoromethylated product significantly. Nitrogen- and sulfur-heterocycles (**13e-13g**) were also successfully trifluoromethylated. Table 1: Screening of fluoroalkyl transition metal catalysts for trifluoromethylation of arenes.aTo better understand the reactivity of [NMe\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}_{2}\\)[Ni(CF\\({}_{3}\\))\\({}_{4}\\)] (**3**) with the Umemoto II reagent (**11**), a stoichiometric reaction was performed and monitored by \\({}^{19}\\)F NMR spectroscopy. Upon mixing **3** with **11** in CD\\({}_{3}\\)CN, the \\({}^{19}\\)F NMR spectrum revealed a transformation that was consistent with the formation of compounds **14** and **15** (Scheme 5, eq 6). Putative compound **14** exhibits a singlet in the \\({}^{19}\\)F NMR spectrum in CD\\({}_{3}\\)CN at \\(\\delta-\\)25.1. The \\({}^{19}\\)F NMR spectrum of compound **15** is more complicated and consists of an apparent undecet at \\(\\delta-\\)19.6 (\\(J\\) = 8.2 Hz) and a quartet at \\(\\delta-\\)28.8 (\\(J\\) = 8.2 Hz). Compound **15** displays similarities in the \\({}^{19}\\)F NMR spectrum to the NCCH\\({}_{2}\\)- (carbon bound) complex [(NCCH\\({}_{2}\\))Ni(CF\\({}_{3}\\))\\({}_{5}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- (**16**), a compound that was formed in trace amounts during the synthesis **3**, fortuitously crystallized, and was structurally characterized (see Supporting Information). The dianionic compound **16** displays resonances at \\(\\delta-\\)24.3 (apparent septet, \\(J\\) = 7.5 Hz) and \\(-\\)27.4 (quartet, \\(J\\) = 7.5 Hz) in CD\\({}_{3}\\)CN. In the absence of arene substrate (Scheme 5), we propose that **15** is formed via a sequential two electron oxidation of **3** by Umemoto II reagent as outlined in eqs 7 and 8. In catalytic reactions where arene trapping agents are present, CF\\({}_{3}\\) radicals sources may originate both by the reaction described in eq 7 and by reductive hemolysis of **17**, which would produce **2** as a byproduct. We speculate that the formation of **14** may arise through redistribution reactions involving trifluoromethyl anion (eq 9). The reactions described in eq **6-9** highlight the ability of solvated nickel to form trifluoromethyl complexes with a variety of coordination numbers, formal oxidation states, and formal overall charges. This flexible accommodation of trifluoromethyl groups may prove to be useful in future methodologies where nickel is required to serve as a reservoir of CF\\({}_{3}\\) anions or",

            "input_text": "## Abstract The synthesis, characterization, and theoretical analysis of meridional americium tribromide tris(tricyclohexylphosphine oxide), **mer-AmBr3(OPcy3)3** has been achieved and is compared with its early lanthanide (La to Nd) analogs. The data show that homo trans ligands show significantly shorter bonds than the cis or hetero trans ligands. This is particularly pronounced in the americium compound. DFT along with multiconfigurational CASSCF calculations show that the contraction of the bonds relates qualitatively with overall covalency, i.e. americium shows the most covalent interactions compared to lanthanides.. However, the involvement of the 5\\(p\\) and 6\\(p\\) shells in bonding follows a different order, namely cerium \\(>\\) neodymium \\(\\sim\\) americium. This study provides further insight into the mechanisms by which ITI operates in low-valent _f_-block complexes. ## Introduction Phosphine oxides are highly stable ligands that have been utilized primarily for catalysis on elements across the periodic table [1]. The study of phosphine oxides with _f_-elements has primarily focused on their use in extraction processes [2, 3, 4, 5] and in (pseudo)halide/nitrate _f_-element starting materials [6, 7, 8, 9]. The effect of two ligands trans to one another is most prototypically examined in the actinyls, \\(\\text{AnO}_{2}^{n+}\\), where the trans-oxygens display unusually short bond distances and high bond strength, best described as bond order of three [10]. This effect, termed the inverse trans influence (ITI) has become the focus of several experimental and theoretical investigations [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. A prototypical examination on the effect of ITI is through the use or meridional octahedral compounds, e.g. _mer_-MX\\({}_{3}\\)L\\({}_{3}\\)**Figure 1**, which has been thoroughly studied in the transition metal series, but is significantly less studied in the _f_-block [18]. However, the primary focus of structural and theoretical studies on actinide molecules displaying the ITI effect have been focused on high valent, +4 to +6, oxidation states [13, 19]. Lanthanides have only been subjected to structural studies in the +3 oxidation state [12, 20], with some analysis of Ce(IV) and hypothetical Pr(IV) and Tb(IV) molecules [15, 17]. The amount of ITI can be quantified as a percentage that implies that the lower the percentage value the larger the ITI effect, **Equation 1,** where \\(r\\) = bond distance, \\(M\\) = metal, \\(X\\) = neutral or anionic ligand [21]. \\[\\text{ITI}=\\frac{\\text{r}(\\text{M}-\\text{X}_{\\text{trans}})}{\\text{r}(\\text{M} -\\text{X}_{\\text{cis}})}\\text{x}100 \\tag{1}\\]nuclear fuel. Long-lived isotopes of Am [\\({}^{241}\\)Am (t\\({}_{1/2}\\) = 432 y), \\({}^{243}\\)Am (t\\({}_{1/2}\\) = 7370 y)] can be transmuted into radionuclides with a much shorter-half life, which is important for the end of the nuclear fuel cycle. However, the separation of these minor actinides from other fission products, such as lanthanides, remains a difficult problem. The additional separation of Am\\({}^{\\text{III}}\\)/C\\({}^{\\text{III}}\\) is a great challenge due to their similar chemical properties and ionic radii. Phosphine oxide ligands have recently demonstrated relatively high selectivity for the Am-Cm pair in the form of (Ph\\({}_{2}\\)PyPO)\\({}_{2}\\)M(NO\\({}_{3}\\))\\({}_{3}\\)[22]. Although phosphine oxides are heavily utilized in separation of _f_-elements relevant to the nuclear fuel cycle, there have been few crystallographic studies for trans-uranium elements, and indeed only the mono and bis[Opy-2,6-CH\\({}_{2}\\)(Ph)\\({}_{2}\\)PO], NOPOPO, adducts has been reported [23]. Herein we examine the synthesis and structure in saturated tri-cyclohexylphosphine oxide adducts of _f_-element tribromides, and the effects of the ITI on tri-valent _f_-elements. Figure 1: General depiction of ligand designations in _mer_-MX\\({}_{3}\\)L\\({}_{3}\\). ### Experimental Details **General Considerations**. _Caution! \\({}^{243}\\)Am (t\\({}_{1/2}\\) = 7,364 years) and its daughters have high specific activity a-particle and, \\(\\gamma\\) emitting radionuclides, and its use presents extreme hazards to human health. This research was conducted in radiological and nuclear facilities with appropriate analyses of these hazards and implementation of controls for the safe handling and manipulation of these toxic and radioactive materials._ **Materials.** All experiments were conducted in air with no attempt to exclude air or water. Reagents and solvents, OPcy\\({}_{3}\\) (cy = cyclohexyl, C\\({}_{6}\\)H\\({}_{11}\\), Alfa Aesar), CDCl\\({}_{3}\\) (Cambridge), \\({}^{2}\\)PrOH (Sigma) NH\\({}_{3(\\text{aq})}\\) (Baker) were purchased from commercial sources and used as received. LnBr\\({}_{3}\\)*6H\\({}_{2}\\)O (Ln = La - Nd) were synthesized by dissolution of Ln\\({}_{2}\\)O\\({}_{3}\\) in concentrated HBr and heated at 150 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C in a box furnace until viscous, then agitated, stirred until cooled to room temperature, dissolved in water and boiled down. This process was repeated twice. The product was washed with ether, to remove residual acid and Br\\({}_{2}\\), until washings were colorless, dried under house vacuum for 10-15 min and stored in a desiccator and used with the assumed hydration number of six. All \\({}^{243}\\)Am synthetic manipulations were performed in a certified chemical fume hood, and a known concentration stock solution was prepared as previously described [24]. Aqueous manipulations were performed with \\(>\\)18 \\(\\Omega\\) water from a Millipore purification system. **Instrumentation.** All \\({}^{1}\\)H, \\({}^{13}\\)C{\\({}^{1}\\)H} and \\({}^{31}\\)P{\\({}^{1}\\)H} NMR spectra were recorded at 294(2) K on a Bruker 600 MHz NMR spectrometer operating at 600.13, 150.90, and 242.94 MHz, respectively, for all lanthanide samples; the sample of \\({}^{\\textbf{243}}\\)**AmBr\\({}_{\\textbf{3}}\\)(OPcy\\({}_{\\textbf{3}}\\))\\({}_{\\textbf{3}}\\)** was recorded at 295(2) K on a Bruker 400 MHz NMR spectrometer operating at 400.17, 100.62, and 161.99 MHz, respectively. \\({}^{1}\\)H and \\({}^{13}\\)C{\\({}^{1}\\)H} were referenced to internal solvent resonances, \\({}^{31}\\)P{\\({}^{1}\\)H} spectra were referenced externally to 85% H\\({}_{3}\\)PO\\({}_{4}\\). For radiologic containment, \\({}^{\\textbf{243}}\\)**AmBr\\({}_{\\textbf{3}}\\)(OPcy\\({}_{\\textbf{3}}\\))\\({}_{\\textbf{3}}\\)** was dissolved in minimal CDCl\\({}_{3}\\), transferred to a PTFE NMR tube liner,sealed, checked for contamination, placed inside a high quality borosilicate NMR tube, and checked again for contamination before being transported to the spectrometer. Due to the paramagnetism of Am\\({}^{3+}\\), Ce\\({}^{3+}\\), Pr\\({}^{3+}\\) and Nd\\({}^{3+}\\), and in particular the small sample size of **\\({}^{\\textbf{243}}\\)AmBr\\({}_{\\textbf{3}}\\)(OPcy3)3**, only unambiguously identifiable peaks are assigned. Single crystal UV/vis/NIR measurements were made using a CRAIC microphotospectrometer on single crystals from 320 to 1700 nm. Single crystals of the lanthanide complexes were mounted on nylon cryoloops with Paratone-N oil. Crystals of **\\({}^{\\textbf{243}}\\)AmBr\\({}_{\\textbf{3}}\\)(OPcy3)3** was mounted with appropriate layers of containment. Crystallographic data from all single crystals were collected on a Bruker D8 Quest diffractometer with a Photon 100 complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) detector, and cooled to 120(2) or 130(2) K using an Oxford Cryostream or CRYO Industries low-temperature device. The instrument was equipped with graphite monochromatized Mo K\\(\\alpha\\) X-ray source (\\(\\lambda\\) = 0.71073 A). The APEX3[25] program package was used to determine the unit-cell parameters and for data collection. The raw frame data was processed using SAINT[26] and SADABS[27] to yield the reflection data file. Subsequent calculations were carried out using the SHELXTL[28, 29] or OLEX2[30] programs. **Theoretical Methods.** The coordinates of **MBr\\({}_{\\textbf{3}}\\)(OPcy3)3** (M = Am, Ce, Nd) for the calculations were obtained directly from the crystal structure to keep the constraints imposed by the solid-state packing. To utilize multiconfigurational calculations, the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) approximation[31] was used as implemented in the ORCA 4.1.1 program[32]. Wave functions were obtained utilizing the SARC-TZVP basis set for the metal centers and the Def2-TZVP basis functions for the rest of the atoms. The active space considered were \\(n\\) electrons (_n_ = 1, 3, 6 for Ce, Nd, and Am) in the seven \\(f\\) orbitals giving rise to a CAS(_n_,7). Scalar relativistic effects were included by the second-order Douglas-Kroll-Hess (DKH2) Hamiltonian. State interactions via quasi-degenerate perturbation theory (QDPT) were used to correct the wave function for spin-orbit coupling (SOC). The resulting wave functions (SO-CAS) were used to analyze the nature of the ground and low-lying excited states, whereas the scalar relativistic wave functions (SR-CAS) were used for further bonding analysis. The nature of the chemical bonds was addressed performing a topological analysis of the electron density using Bader's quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analysis. Key elements within QTAIM were extracted such as the electron density, delocalization indices, and energy densities at the interatomic region (bond critical point, BCP) which have been employed previously for this aim [33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41]. The covalency was analyzed, on one hand, by changes in the concentration of the electron density at the BCP along with changes in the delocalization indices. On the other hand, energy densities show the polarization of the covalent bond by looking at the ratios between potential [V(r)] and kinetic [G(r)] energy densities, which for partial covalent bonds lie in between values of 1 and 2. The total energy density shows the degree of covalency that is represented by the level of predominance of the potential over the kinetic energy density [42]. A model system was also investigated where the cyclohexyl groups were replaced by methyl groups to simplify the molecular orbital energy diagram picture and allow the observations between the Am, Ce and Nd complexes to be made. The methyl groups were re-optimized while the rest of the molecule was kept frozen to conserve the crystal structure of the metal surrounding atoms. These calculations were performed in the ADF2019 suite [43, 44] using the PBE functional along with the TZP basis set. Frozen-core and all-electron calculations were performed for the full structure to prove the role of 5/6\\(p\\) orbitals in the stabilization of the complexes at the same level of theory. Additionally, ligand-field DFT [45, 46] was used to examine the reduction of the inter-electronic repulsion within the 5/6\\(p\\) shell due to central-field and symmetry-restricted covalency. The procedure used herein has been previously described for Cs\\({}_{2}\\)KYF\\({}_{6}\\):Pr [45], where occupation numbers in the \\(f\\)-shell were allowed to be fractional. The reductions were obtained not only with respect to the free-ions but also compared to the nona-aquo complexes, [M(H\\({}_{2}\\)O)\\({}_{9}\\)]\\({}^{3+}\\), where the geometries were taken from the crystalized structures in the literature [47, 48, 49]. **Synthesis of \\({}^{243}\\)AmBr\\({}_{3}\\)(OPcy\\({}_{3}\\))\\({}_{3}\\).** An aliquot of \\({}^{243}\\)Am (3.0 mg, 12 \\(\\mu\\)mol) was drawn from a 2 M HCl stock solution and precipitated with excess NH\\({}_{3(\\mathrm{aq})}\\) to give a pale yellow solid naively formulated as Am(OH)\\({}_{3}\\), washed with water (2 \\(\\times\\) 2 mL), suspended in \\(\\sim\\) 1 mL of water and dissolved with HBr (concentrated, \\(\\sim\\)0.5 mL) to give a yellow solution. The yellow solution was transferred to a 20 mL scintillation vial, placed under a heat lamp and gently evaporated to a yellow residue formulated as AmBr\\({}_{3}\\)*nH\\({}_{2}\\)O. The residue was dissolved in 'PrOH (1.50 mL) to give a dark yellow solution. A colorless solution of OPcy\\({}_{3}\\) (11 mg, 38 \\(\\mu\\)mol) in 'PrOH (1.00 mL) was added to the Am solution, which quickly became turbid and clear again. The solution was capped and left to stand undisturbed. Over 3 h amber colored X-ray quality crystals were deposited.

            "output_text": "In this study, the synthesis, characterization, and computational analysis of meridional americium tribromide tris(tricyclohexylphosphine oxide), denoted as **mer-AmBr3(OPcy3)3**, were accomplished and compared to earlier analogues of early lanthanides (lanthanides from La to Nd). The results revealed that homotranslative ligands, which are two ligands directly across from each other, exhibit significantly shorter bond lengths compared to cis or heterotranslative ligands. This effect, known as inverse trans influence (ITI), is particularly pronounced in the americium complex. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, in conjunction with multiconfigurational Complete Active Space Self-Consistent Field (CASSCF) calculations, showed that the bond contractions are correlated with the overall covalency, with americium demonstrating the strongest covalent interactions among the lanthanides.\n\nHowever, the involvement of 5\\(p\\) and 6\\(p\\) orbitals in bonding deviated from the general trend, with cerium having stronger covalency than neodymium, which in turn was similar to americium. This study contributes to understanding the mechanisms of ITI in low-valent f-block complexes. \n\n### Experimental Details\n\nThe synthesis of **mer-AmBr3(OPcy3)3** involved the reaction of **243**Am with NH\\(_3\\) in a controlled environment, considering the radioactivity and hazards associated with the element. The lanthanide tribromides, LnBr\\(_3\\)·6H\\(_2\\)O (for La to Nd), were synthesized by dissolving the corresponding lanthanum oxides in concentrated hydrobromic acid and heating, followed by purification steps. Single crystals for structural analysis were obtained after evaporation and suitable treatment.\n\nTheoretical calculations were performed using ORCA 4.1.1 with the CASSCF method, including relativistic corrections for spin-orbit coupling, and a combination of Bader's QTAIM analysis and DFT to investigate the electronic structure and covalency of the compounds. To simplify comparisons, a model system with methyl groups replacing cyclohexyl ones was also computed.\n\n### Synthesis of \\({}^{243}\\)AmBr\\({}_{3}\\)(OPcy\\({}_{3}\\))\\({}_{3}\\)\n\nA sequence of reactions involving the formation of Am(OH)\\(_3\\) from **243**Am, followed by dissolving it in HBr and reacting with OPcy\\(_3\\) in PrOH resulted in the isolation of **AmBr\\({}_{3}\\)(OPcy\\({}_{3}\\))\\({}_{3}\\)** as a yellow/brown crystalline solid. The compound was characterized using NMR spectroscopy and UV/vis/NIR spectroscopy, confirming its identity.\n\n### General Synthesis of LnBr\\(_3\\)(OPcy\\(_3\\))\\(_3\\), (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd)\n\nA simplified synthesis was developed for the lanthanide analogues, starting with a colorless OPcy\\(_3\\) solution in PrOH and a yellow LnBr\\(_3\\)·6H\\(_2\\)O solution, leading to the formation of colorless crystals. Single crystal X-ray diffraction and solid state spectroscopy confirmed the structure and composition of these compounds. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis work contributes to the understanding of the ITI effect in f-block complexes by studying the structural and electronic properties of **mer-AmBr3(OPcy3)3** and comparing it to early lanthanide analogues. The results highlight the role of ligand type and the 5\\(p\\) and 6\\(p\\) orbitals in determining bonding patterns in these systems. The synthesis and characterization of the americium compound provide valuable insights into the separation and processing of actinides in nuclear fuel cycles."

The more solubilizing bromide anion was studied instead. The known _mer-LnBr3(OPcy3)3_ (_mer_ = meridional; cy = cyclohexyl, C6H11) have been recently reported and give opportunity for extension to the trivalent actinides, though small lanthanides can speciate [54, 55, 56, 50]. There has been just one report of a single crystal Am-Br compound, **AmBr3(THF)4**[57]. The previously reported syntheses of _mer-LnBr3(OPcy)3_, (cy = cyclohexyl, C6H11) utilized boiling ethanol and describe the complexes as having low solubility [50]. By changing the alcohol to iso-propyl alcohol ('ProOH) and working on a scale relevant to actinides, ie \\(\\leq\\) 0.02 mmol of metal content, a smooth synthesis is obtained. This was extended to americium by starting from a stock solution of AmCl3*nH2O in HCl, precipitating the hydroxide and dissolving the product in HBr(aq) and evaporated to dryness forming a putative AmBr3*nH2O. Combining the components in 'ProOH initially forms a turbid solution which clarified within minutes and upon standing at room temperature, amber colored X-ray quality crystals formedwithin 2 h, **Equation 2**. A small sample was removed for spectroscopy and the solution was left to stand several days to increase the crystalline yield before work up, **Figure 2**. **Crystallography. AmBr3(OPcy3)3** crystallizes as the meridional isomer, **mer-AmBr3(OPcy3)3**, in the orthorhombic \\(Pca2_{1}\\) space group and is isomorphous with its lanthanide analogs [25]. Based on the Flack parameter, a small (\\(\\leq 3\\%\\)) enantiomorphic twin was dealt with using a TWIN/BASF refinement, see ESI [58]. The Am-Br bond lengths fall into two classes, that of axial (ax) and equatorial (eq) ligands, where axial ligands consistent of a homo-ligand trans to the ligand of interest, and equatorial ligands where a hetero ligand is trans to the ligand of interest, **Figure 1**. The Am-O\\({}_{\\text{ax}}\\) bond lengths are 2.302(7), and 2.312(7) A while the Am-O\\({}_{\\text{eq}}\\) bond is 2.349(6) A, a separation of 3\\(\\sigma\\). The Am-Br\\({}_{\\text{ax}}\\) atoms display a bond distance of 2.870(1), and 2.882(1) A and the Br\\({}_{\\text{eq}}\\) atom displays a significantly longer distance of 2.912(1) A. These values are all significantly longer than the 2.8222(6), 2.8445(6), and 2.8610(6) A bond lengths reported in **AmBr\\({}_{\\text{3}}\\)(THF)\\({}_{\\text{4}}\\)**.[57] However, all of the 2.466(4)-2.533(4) A Am-O\\({}_{\\text{THF}}\\) bond lengths in **AmBr\\({}_{\\text{3}}\\)(THF)\\({}_{\\text{4}}\\)** are significantly longer than Am-O bond lengths in **AmBr\\({}_{\\text{3}}\\)(OPcy3)\\({}_{\\text{3}}\\)**. The 2.34(1)-2.51(1) A Am-O bond lengths reported for the NOPOPO ligand in **Am(NOPOPO)(NO3)\\({}_{\\text{3}}\\)** and **[Am(NOPOPO)2(NO3)][NO3]\\({}_{\\text{2}}\\)** [NOPO = Bis[(phosphino)methyl]pyridine-1-oxide, Opy-2,6-CH\\({}_{2}\\)(Ph)\\({}_{2}\\)PO] are only comparable to 2.349(6) A Am-O\\({}_{\\text{eq}}\\) bond since the Am-O\\({}_{\\text{ax}}\\) bond lengths are all significantly shorter, **Table 1**.[23] All of the X-Am-Y bond angles are between 85.2(2)-95.60(5)\\({}^{\\circ}\\) for cis ligands and 172.74(3)-178.1(2)\\({}^{\\circ}\\) for trans ligands, see ESI. In the course of preparing the synthesis of _mer-_**AmBr\\({}_{\\text{3}}\\)(OPcy3)\\({}_{\\text{3}}\\)**, the analogous lanthanides, La-Nd, were examined using the modified synthesis stated above, since the 6-coordinate radius of Am\\({}^{3+}\\), 0.975 A, is most closely related to Nd\\({}^{3+}\\), 0.983 A.[59] It was found that the Nd and Pr analogs, _mer_-LnBr3(OPcy3)3,_ are isomorphous with the previously reported structures, except the half occupied lattice water was not located in our structures, see ESI[50]. The Ce analog, _mer_-CeBr3(OPcy3)3 is not yet reported and the structure was collected. The La analog was reported in the \\(P2_{1}\\) space group with a lattice ethanol molecule, _mer_-LaBr3(OPcy3)3**EtOH**, however upon synthesis in \\({}^{i}\\)PrOH, the isomorphous \\(Pca2_{1}\\) unit cell was obtained and is reported here, see ESI. Crystals of **CeBr3(OPcy3)3** are orange, while crystals of the La, Pr and Nd analogs are all colorless. Bulk samples of **PrBr3(OPcy3)3** and **NdBr3(OPcy3)3** are pale yellow and pale green, respectively. The bond metrics of the lanthanides examined here all display the same axial/equatorial bonding patterns, that being axial ligands display much shorter bond lengths than equatorial ligands, with distorted octahedral geometries, see ESI. With this data in hand, the calculations of ITI effect from **Eq. 1** were carried out on the **MBr3(OPcy3)3** (M = Am, La, Ce, Pr, Nd) complexes examined here. The data show that a subtle increase in ITI effect is seen with decreasing ionic radius, **Table 2**, all of the data are within the error of one another. When the ITI calculations were repeated using the crystallographic data for the previously published **LnBr3(OPcy3)3** compounds (Ln = La, Pr, Nd, Gd, Ho), as well as **LnI3(Et2O)3,**[20]**LnCl3(HMPA)3,**[60, 61, 62] and the series **YbX3(THF)3** (X = Cl, Br, I)[63, 64]. The data shows no clear trends or patterns with respect to lanthanide or halide identity, where the halide ligands usually show no ITI. The oxygen donors follow the pattern in terms of ITI values where: Et2O > THF > HMPA, which appears counter intuitive since HMPA is regarded as a strong donor, while Et2O is regarded as a weak donor, see ESI for data tables. Without more sophisticated investigations and based on these small data sets, it is not clear what ligands affect the values for ITI calculations in terms of donor strength, steric bulk and crystallization effects. No analogous actinide compounds were located, likely due to the prevalence of the +4 oxidation state in the early actinides and the scarcity of trans-plutonium crystallographic data. Electronic Absorption Spectroscopy.The electronic absorption spectroscopy for \\(\\mathbf{AmBr_{3}(OPcy_{3})_{3}}\\) shows an intense charge transfer band centered at \\(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{max}}\\) 340 nm (29,411 cm\\({}^{-1}\\)) in addition to the Laporte forbidden 5_f_\\(\\rightarrow\\)5\\(f\\) transitions characteristic of Am\\({}^{\\mathrm{III}}\\)[65, 66]. With few exceptions, the energies of the absorptions are similar to those reported in the low temperature spectrum of AmBr\\({}_{3}\\) and the recently reported spectrum of (PPh\\({}_{4}\\))\\({}_{3}\\)AmCl\\({}_{6}\\)[67]. The characteristic \\({}^{5}\\)L\\({}_{6}\\) excitation reported at 510 nm (19,588 cm\\({}^{-1}\\)) shifted to 508 nm (19,685 cm\\({}^{-1}\\)), **Figure 3**. The compound was not fluorescent at room temperature even with long integration times (\\(\\leq 2000\\) ms) at an excitation wavelength of 365 or 420 nm. \\(\\mathbf{CeBr_{3}(OPcy_{3})_{3}}\\) displays an intense charge transfer band with \\(\\lambda_{\\mathrm{max}}\\) of 339 nm (29,479 cm\\({}^{-1}\\)). \\(\\mathbf{NdBr_{3}(OPcy_{3})_{3}}\\) reveals, sharp hypersensitive transitions of low intensity between 500-607 nm consistent with the \\({}^{4}\\)G\\({}_{7/2}\\) and \\({}^{4}\\)G\\({}_{5/2}\\) excitations, similar to the values reported for NdBr\\({}_{3(\\mathrm{g})}\\) at 1195 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C, while several of the typical 4_f_\\(\\rightarrow\\)4\\(f\\) transitions reported for Nd(ClO\\({}_{4}\\))\\({}_{3(\\mathrm{aq})}\\) were not observed [68, 69, 70]. \\(\\mathbf{LaBr_{3}(OPcy_{3})_{3}}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{PrBr_{3}(OPcy_{3})_{3}}\\) gave no UV/vis/NIR peaks between 320-1700 nm. The former is typical of the 5_d\\({}^{0}\\)4_f_\\({}^{0}\\) La\\({}^{3+}\\) ion, while the latter is unusual for the 4_f_\\({}^{2}\\) Pr\\({}^{3+}\\) ion [70], this may be due to the pseudo inversion center present in **MBr3(OPcy3)3**. Though the Pr\\({}^{3+}\\) ion possesses hypersensitive \\({}^{3}\\)P\\({}_{2}\\) and \\({}^{1}\\)D\\({}_{2}\\) transitions at 444.4 nm (22,500cm\\({}^{-1}\\)) and 588.2 nm (17,000 cm\\({}^{-1}\\)), respectively, but were not observed through repeated collections, see ESI for spectra [69, 70]. None of the lanthanide compounds were fluorescent. **Multi-nuclear NMR Spectroscopy.** In order to gain more insight into the system, and due to the convenient spectroscopic handle provided by the \\({}^{31}\\)P nucleus, \\({}^{1}\\)H, \\({}^{13}\\)C{\\({}^{1}\\)H} and \\({}^{31}\\)P{\\({}^{1}\\)H} multi nuclear NMR spectra were recorded. Due to radiological constraints and small sample sizes obtaining NMR spectra on americium samples can be difficult. Exceptions have included Evans' Method studies [71], a notable solid state MAS study of AmO\\({}_{2}\\)[72] and the recent report of Am(C\\({}_{5}\\)Me\\({}_{4}\\)H)\\({}_{3}\\)[73]. Some \\({}^{31}\\)P{\\({}^{1}\\)H} data has been reported previously for other **LnBr3(OPcy3)3** complexes [50], here we seek to add to this data and compare it with its americium analog. Because of the weak paramagnetism of the 5_f_[6] Am\\({}^{3+}\\) ion, 1.64 \\(\\mu_{\\rm B}\\)[71], a shorter relaxation time (d1 = 1 sec) was utilized along with several extra scans to obtain a good signal for **AmBr3(OPcy3)3** at a shift of \\(\\delta\\) 108.89 ppm, **Figure 4**. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of a \\({}^{31}\\)P NMR signal in an americium complex. The signal is similar in chemical shift to the 4_f_[1]**CeBr3(OPcy3)3** at \\(\\delta\\) 109.48 ppm. Both signals are shifted down field from the diamagnetic **LaBr3(OPcy3)3** (\\(\\delta\\) 60.314 ppm) and the free ligand OPcy3 (\\(\\delta\\) 50.574 ppm) which was recorded for comparison. The more paramagnetic 4_f_[2] and 4_f_[3]**PrBr3(OPcy3)3** and **NdBr3(OPcy3)3** are significantly shifted further down field (\\(\\delta\\) 212.4 and 190.2 ppm, respectively) and are significantly broadened (4290 and 1366 Hz, respectively), **Figure 4**. Due to the high fluxionality of the cyclohexyl rings the \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectra are complicated and provide limited information. In particular the paramagnetism in **PrBr3(OPcy3)3** and **NdBr3(OPcy3)3** give rise to several broad peaks over a range of about 20 ppm, some with widths over 1400 Hz, see ESI for spectra. The \\({}^{13}\\)C{\\({}^{1}\\)H} NMR spectra of **MBr3(OPcy3)3** show several signals and are consistent with a single chemical environment for the carbons. Due to the small sample size of **AmBr3(OPcy3)3** only three of the expected four signals were observed, with the _ipso_-carbon likely being too broad and weak to be observed in this experiment, though a doublet at \\(\\delta\\) 27.08 ppm with \\(J_{\\rm CP}\\) coupling constant of 27 Hz is consistent with the carbon \\(\\alpha\\) to the ipso-carbon. For the diamagnetic free ligand and **LaBr3(OPcy3)3** both 1-bond and 2-bond C-P coupling was observed with constants of ca 35 and 27 Hz, respectively. While only the 1-bond C-P coupling was observed in **CeBr3(OPcy3)3** and no coupling was observed in the **Pr** and **Nd** compounds, see ESI for spectra. ### Theoretical Analysis **Bonding Analysis.** To obtain a deeper understanding of the bonding in **MBr3**(**OPcy3**)**3**, a Quantum Theory of Atoms In Molecules (QTAIM) analysis was performed to calculate the concentration of electron density p(r), delocalization indices \\(\\delta\\)(r), and energy densities [potential, V(r), kinetic, G(r), and total energy densities, H(r)]. All of these metrics are utilized to determine the degree of covalency exhibited in the bonding interactions. Based on previous studies where the nature of bonding interactions of \\(f\\)-block complexes has been shown that bonds are not formally covalent, but rather partially covalent.[39, 40, 74] A partial covalent bond implies positive values for the Laplacian of the electron density, \\(\\nabla\\)p(r), and negative values for total energy densities, H(r). Here, the term \"covalency\" refers to the metal-ligand interaction needed to experience orbital overlap, which is reflected by the buildup of electron density [p(r)] in the interatomic region. Furthermore, covalency can be enhanced by a better energy match between the atomic orbital involved, which is reflected by the delocalization of the electrons in the interatomic region. From a general perspective the results herein show that the M-Br bonds displays a low concentration of electron density in the interatomic region compared to the M-O bonds, **Figure 5a**, though similar delocalization indices, **Figure 5b**, implying that the covalency in the M-O bonds occur due to increased orbital overlap, whereas the better energy match between parent metal-ligand orbitals for the M-Br bonds compensate for the lack of electron density concentration. A more subtle difference is observed in the energy density of the M-O bonds, particularly the M-O(3) bond where **CeBr3(OPcy3)3** most resembles **AmBr3(OPcy3)3**. Whereas the M-Br bonds of **CeBr3(OPcy3)3** and **NdBr3(OPcy3)3** are closer to each other, 5/6\\(p\\) shell, which confirms the presence of the ITI in these systems. However, the energies of stabilization do not correlate with the trend observed for the ITI percentages coming directly from the contraction of the bonds in the _trans_ positions. This is not necessarily true for a system presenting more than one ITI mechanism because they compete within the same molecule, and therefore become more complicated to analyze. For clarity in the construction of an MO energy level diagram, the cyclohexyl rings were truncated to methyl groups, _e.g._ MBr\\({}_{3}\\)(OPMe\\({}_{3}\\))\\({}_{3}\\), Figure 7.[75]",

Another way to show the role of the Ln/An 5/6\\(p\\) orbitals in ITI is to assess the reduction of the electron repulsion of these semi-core electrons in the complex with respect to the free-ion. Within ligand field theory (LFT) the one-electron inter-electronic repulsion integrals are described by the Slater-Condon parameters F\\({}^{\\text{k}}\\)(nl,nl) (n = shell, l = _s,p,d,f_) and the spin-orbit coupling parameter \\(\\zeta_{\\text{nl}}\\).[76, 77] Previous studies have successfully applied a non-empirical method to obtain these parameters using a ligand-field DFT (LFDFT) capable of predicting the electronic structure of lanthanide complexes.[78, 79, 80, 81, 45] Since the reductions of the Slater-Condon parameters with respect to the free-ion are related to the central-field and symmetry-restricted covalency, their evaluation will provide further insight into the nature of ITI in these complexes. The reduction of the LF parameters is considerably larger in **CeBr\\({}_{3}\\)(OPcy\\({}_{3}\\))\\({}_{3}\\)** compared to **NdBr\\({}_{3}\\)(OPcy\\({}_{3}\\))\\({}_{3}\\)** and **AmBr\\({}_{3}\\)(OPcy\\({}_{3}\\))\\({}_{3}\\),** whose reductions are similar, **Table 4**. These results agree with the stabilization energies obtained between frozen-core to all-electron calculations, confirming the presence of ITI. This also shows that the sizable reductions indicate an important covalent component related to the 5/6\\(p\\) orbital involvement in the interaction between the metal ions and the Br and phosphine oxide ligands. The differences in bonding observed between lanthanides and actinides make the comparison more complicated due to the involvement of the 5\\(f\\) electrons in the case of americium, which significantly increases the covalent character of the bond. In this context, only Ce and Nd could be compared with QTAIM metrics, where delocalization and total energy densities predict the trend observed in the stabilization energies from the involvement of the 5\\(p\\) electrons. ## Conclusions The synthesis and characterization of **AmBr3(OPcy3)3** has been achieved and shows the same meridinal coordination geometry as the larger lanthanides. Spectroscopic analysis by single crystal X-ray diffraction shows that the homo-trans ligands display significantly short bonds than the hetero-trans ligands. Single crystal UV/vis/NIR spectra show large charge transfer bands for the Ce and Am complexes and hypersensitive transitions for the Nd and Am analogs due to the pseudo-inversion center. Analysis by \\({}^{31}\\)P NMR spectroscopy illustrates the weak paramagnetism of the 5_f_[6] Am\\({}^{3+}\\) center. Bonding analyses show that the complex displays a significant inverse trans influence (ITI) with the bonding ligands, though its mechanism is not directly related to the involvement of the 5/6\\(p\\) electrons. This suggests that there is an interplay between the involvement of valence electrons that significantly separates the lanthanides from the actinides. It is surprising that Ce shows the highest amount of 5\\(p\\) electron involvement in covalency. This is observed by the reduction of the electron-electron repulsion of the 5\\(p\\) shell compared to the aquo-complex, [Ce(H\\({}_{2}\\)O)\\({}_{9}\\)]\\({}^{3+}\\). This study provides further evidence of ITI in low-valent _f_-block complexes, and their potential occurrence in heavier actinides, whose chemistry is dominated by the trivalent oxidation state. Furthermore, it constitutes a new feature that can be exploited for rational ligand design in order to achieve selective ligands for separations in nuclear waste treatment.",

            "input_text": "Dynamic covalent gels have been synthesized from an aromatic trialdehyde and \\(\\alpha\\),\\(\\omega\\)-dinitroalkanes via the nitroaldol reaction in organic solvents. The gelation process could be finetuned by changing the starting nitroalkanes, solvents, feed concentration, catalyst loading, or reaction temperature. The resulting organogels demonstrated good structural integrity and excellent self-healing ability. Intact xerogels were produced upon drying, without damaging the network, and the solvent-free network could recover its gel form in the presence of an organic solvent. Furthermore, the crosslinked dynameric gel depolymerized to small molecules in response to excess nitromethane. ## Introduction The application of dynamic covalent chemistry into the field of polymer science has given rise to fascinating dynamic covalent polymers (dynamers) with emergent properties [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. Equipped with reversible covalent linkages, dynamers can undergo bond exchange and constitutional, structural rearrangement, thus leading to a wide spectrum of properties, such as stimuli-responsiveness, self-healing ability, shape-memory behavior, degradability and recyclability, antimicrobial and wound-dressing abilities, etc. [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32]. Due to the large scope of available dynamic building blocks and the versatility of reversible covalent reactions, dynamers of a wide diversity of topologies, _e.g._ linear structures [1, 5, 33, 34], amorphous networks [35, 2, 36, 37, 34], and dynamic covalent frameworks [38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43], have been discovered in the past decades. One of the major polymeric architectures, polymer networks, can be generated through crosslinking of polymer chains or through the reaction of multifunctional monomers. The resulting network formation brings about robustness and stability to the material [44, 45, 46]. However, due to the permanent nature of the irreversible covalent linkages, many conventional network polymers, especially thermosets, are fixed in structure and typically not easily repairable or recyclable, causing many environmental problems [47, 48]. Fortunately, crosslinked dynamers, also referred to as covalent adaptable networks or vitrimers, have been developed by replacing covalent bonds with dynamic counterparts, therefore allowing constitutional structural adjustments in the polymer matrices [37, 49, 50, 51, 52]. Thanks to this, network dynamers can be easilyreprogrammed and recycled through reversible reactions, such as imine and hydrazome formation and exchange [19, 24, 53, 54]. Diels-Alder reaction [55, 56, 57, 58, 59], boronate formation [6, 61, 60, 61], transesterification [47, 50, 62, 63], and other transformations [20, 23, 36, 64, 65]. Our previous studies have revealed the high efficiency of the nitroaldol (Henry) reaction in generating linear dynamers with reversible C-C bonds [1, 5]. These polymers have demonstrated excellent dynamicity and intricate topological changes in response to the applied conditions. However, the application of the nitroaldol reaction in the formation of more complex polymer systems has not been extensively explored. This is, however, of great importance, since this approach would give rise to new types of functional materials based on dynamic and stimuli-responsive C-C bonds, and raises the prospect of addressing challenges of conventional crosslinked polymers [47, 48]. In the present study, we have addressed the feasibility of constructing crosslinked dynamers through the nitroaldol reaction and investigated the properties of the resulting materials. We thus report the crosslinking and gelation of an aromatic trialdehyde with different \\(\\alpha\\),\\(\\omega\\)-dinitroalkanes in organic solvents. The gelation process was examined through chemical and mechanical approaches, and the effects on the gelation were investigated. Moreover, the responsive behavior of the organogels, including self-healing and degradation, are also demonstrated. ## Results and Discussion In light of the high efficiency and dynamicity of the nitroaldol reaction between formylpyridines and nitroalkanes [1, 5], dynamic crosslinking systems composed of 2,4,6-pyridinetricarboxaldehyde (**1**) and \\(\\alpha\\),\\(\\omega\\)-dinitroalkanes **2a-h** were designed. Thus, the interconnections between tritopic compound **1** and ditopic compounds **2a-h** in a molar ratio of 2:3 would be able to generate dynamic polymers displaying an intricate three-dimensional network topology (**Figure 1a**). To evaluate the proposed crosslinking reaction, a dual entry-point equilibration study was initially performed on a model system (**Figure 1b**, Figure S1) [1, 66]. The reaction of trialdehyde **1** with monotopic 1-nitro propane (**4**) in deuterated dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO-d\\({}_{6}\\)) was triggered by adding triethylamine as the catalyst. As shown in the \\({}^{1}\\)H-NMR spectrum (**Figure 1d**), upon reaching equilibrium, nitroaldol adducts (o) were produced in the presence of small amounts of partially-reacted trialdehyde (\\(\\bullet\\) ), and the starting nitroalkane (\\(\\bigtriangledown\\)). However, no unreacted trialdehyde signals were observed at equilibrium, indicating the high efficiency of the forward nitroaldol reaction in this system. The reverse reaction was then carried out by adding Et\\({}_{3}\\)N into a DMSO-d\\({}_{6}\\) solution of trinitroalcohol **5**. At equilibrium, the partial decomposition of compound **5** and the appearance of compound **4**, together with trace amounts of molecular species (\\(\\bullet\\) ) with both nitroalcohol and aldehyde groups on the pyridine ring, reveal the occurrence of the retro-nitroaldol process (**Figure 1e**). By comparison of the \\({}^{1}\\)H-NMR spectra, the equilibrium compositions of the forward reaction between compounds **1** and **4** and the retro-nitroaldol reaction of compound **5**, were in close agreement. These results demonstrate that the reactions from opposite directions settled into an equilibrium state closer to the trinitroalcohol side than the starting materials side in the model system. This indicates that the proposed nitroaldol crosslinking process could lead to the efficient, while reversible, formation of dynamers. Network dynamic formation was subsequently addressed, and the reactions of trialdehyde **1** with eight dinitroalkanes **2a-h** in DMSO were investigated (Figure S16, Table S1). Dinitroalkanes with even numbers of carbon atoms displayed better gelation performance than the other four building blocks, which could be reflective of the odd-even alternation patternsin the thermodynamic properties of unbranched alkanes [67, 68, 69, 70]. Twelve organic solvents, in which the starting materials were well soluble, were then screened to find the ideal environment for gelation (Figure S11, Table S2). Stable gelation was observed in five of the tested solvents. Eventually, DMSO was selected as the solvent for all subsequent experiments because of the short gelation time and high gel stability. \\({}^{1}\\)H-NMR was next used to monitor the reaction between compounds **1** and **2d** in DMSO-d\\({}_{6}\\). As can be seen in **Figure 2a**, the reaction started immediately upon addition of triethylamine. Compound **1**, displaying aldehyde signals at 10.25 ppm and 10.15 ppm, was consumed within minutes, while new aldehyde peaks corresponding to di- and monoaldehydes appeared in a more upfield region (9.90-10.12 ppm). All aldehyde peaks disappeared within 30 minutes showing the high reaction conversion. The dinitroalkane \\(\\alpha\\)-proton resonance at 4.53 ppm showed similar changes, gradually decreasing until almost complete disappearance over the experiment time period. Meanwhile, new signals grew in, bearing distinct resemblance, albeit Figure 1: a) Proposed nitroaldol crosslinking polymerization system; b) model nitroaldol system; \\({}^{1}\\)H NMR spectra (400 MHz, DMSO-d\\({}_{6}\\)) of c) initial mixture of compounds **1** (\\(\\Box\\)) and **4** (\\(\\bigtriangledown\\)); d) mixture of compounds **1**, **4**, and Et\\({}_{y}\\)N after 24 h of incubation at rt; e) mixture of compound **5** (\\(\\circ\\)) and Et\\({}_{y}\\)N after 24 h of incubation at rt; f) compound **5**. broadened, to the peaks corresponding to those of the reference nitroalcohol **5** (Figure S4), indicating the formation of nitroalcohol polymers [1, 5]. It should be noted that all signals were significantly broadened after ~20 min due to the sol-gel transition in the NMR tube, further indicating an efficient polymerization and gelation process in the reaction. The gelation process of compounds **1** and **2d** in DMSO was also subjected to oscillatory shear rheology analysis (**Figure 2b**, Figure S12) [44, 71]. In the early stage of the reaction, the signals recorded were more scattered due to the values being closer to the detection limit of the instrument. Nevertheless, the loss moduli _G\"_ were generally higher than the storage moduli _G'_ during this time range, thereby matching the behavior of liquids [72]. After about 800 s, higher shear moduli were observed, because of the development of polymers, where the loss moduli _G\"_ were higher than the storage moduli _G'_. At 825 s, the value of _G'_ dramatically overtook _G\"_, indicating the transition from a solution phase to a viscoelastic solid, and marking the critical point of gelation [72, 20]. As the reaction progressed, the shear moduli _G'_ and _G\"_ continued to grow until they reached their respective plateaus after approximately 1 h (Figure S12). The resulting transparent organogel showed a _G'_ of 6.6\\(\\times\\)10\\({}^{4}\\) Pa, a _G\"_ of 44.4 Pa and a loss tangent (tan \\(\\delta\\), _G\"/G'_) of 6.7\\(\\times\\)10\\({}^{-4}\\). These rheology results visualized a clear and efficient gelation process and demonstrated the good mechanical performance of the obtained gel. The gelation time under different feed concentrations of the starting materials, determined by the tube inversion method, was furthermore investigated (**Figure 3a**). When the loading concentration of trialdehyde **1** was lower than 0.3 M, no gelation was observed in the reaction between compounds **1** and **2d** in DMSO, pointing at weaker polymer entanglement and hampered incorporation of solvent molecules under such dilute conditions. However, gel formation occurred readily in more concentrated solutions, in which the gelation time Figure 3: Effects of a) trialdehyde feed concentration (ratio **1/2d**: 2:3**); b) NEI\\({}_{3}\\) loading; and c) temperature on gelation time in reaction between **1** and **2d** in DMSO._ Figure 2: a) ‘H-NMR spectra (2.25 min interval; DMSO-d\\({}_{o}\\), 400 MHz); b) time sweep oscillatory rheology profile (storage modulus G’ (blue), loss modulus G” (orange)) of the reaction between compounds **1** and **2d** in DMSO at 0–30 min (0.5 M of feed concentration; 10 mol% Et\\({}_{3}\\)N). decreased with the increase of feed concentration in the range of 0.3 M-0.5 M. This is in agreement with the fact that denser and more entangled polymer networks, resulting from more concentrated systems, can hold the solvent more easily.[73] The effect of the catalyst loading on the gelation process was next evaluated (**Figure 3b**). In the system with 5 mol% of added Et\\({}_{3}\\)N, the DMSO solution of compounds **1** and **2d** gelated in 35 min. With higher loadings, the gelation time decreased significantly, reaching a value of 7 min at 25 mol% NE\\({}_{3}\\). This gelation time effect is consistent with the reaction rate dependency on the catalyst concentration in nitroaldol polymerization systems.[1] The reaction temperature was also varied in order to evaluate the thermal effects on the gelation process (**Figure 3c**). In the range of 25-60 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C, the solution gelated more rapidly with the increase in temperature, associated with accelerating the reaction rate and promoting polymerization.[74, 75] However, when the reaction temperature reached or passed 65 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C, no gelation or aggregation was observed. This reveals a sharp temperature-dependency of the polymer interactions within the crosslinked network.[76, 77] The obtained nitroaldol network polymers were found to be insoluble in water, enabling removal of DMSO and triethylamine without significantly affecting the gel structure. When the gels were repeatedly immersed in deionized water and cleared from excess solvent, the gel remained largely intact, albeit becoming more opaque and more brittle. This also resulted in termination of the reversible nitroaldol reaction, thereby preserving the crosslinked polymer networks. In addition, xerogels could be obtained and analyzed without interference from other gel contents upon drying. Moreover, once the dry network polymer was again exposed to DMSO, the xerogel structure absorbed the solvent and reformed a gel within minutes, although with some associated deformation (Figure S15). These results reveal the robustness of the nitroaldol-crosslinked network and its potential applications in absorption. The FTIR spectra of compounds **1**, **2d** and the solvent-free polymer **3d** revealed that the aldehyde C=O stretch signal at 1705 cm\\({}^{-1}\\) and the C-H stretch signal at 2873 cm\\({}^{-1}\\) almost disappeared after the reaction, whereas a broad O-H stretch peak appeared at 3436 cm\\({}^{-1}\\) in the spectrum of the polymer (**Figure 4a**). These changes indicate consumption of the aldehyde moieties and formation of new hydroxyl groups. In contrast, the stretch signals emanating from the nitro groups remained in the spectrum of dynamer **3d**, although with slight shifts at 1544 cm\\({}^{-1}\\) and 1368 cm\\({}^{-1}\\).

This gelation process can be fine-tuned by altering various factors, including the choice of nitroalkanes, solvents, feed concentration, catalyst loading, and reaction temperature. The resulting organogels exhibit remarkable structural integrity and exceptional self-healing capabilities. Upon drying, xerogels are formed without damaging the network, and the solvent-free gel can recover its gel form upon exposure to an organic solvent.\n\nThe introduction to dynamic covalent chemistry in polymer science has led to the discovery of dynamic covalent polymers (dynamers), characterized by reversible covalent linkages that enable them to exhibit unique properties like stimuli responsiveness, self-healing, and shape-memory. These polymers encompass diverse topologies, such as linear, amorphous networks, and dynamic covalent frameworks.\n\nIn this study, the authors aimed to explore the feasibility of creating dynamic covalent gels using the nitroaldol reaction and examined the properties of the resulting materials. Aromatic trialdehyde was combined with α,ω-dinitroalkanes in a molar ratio of 2:3, expecting to form a three-dimensional network through the reaction. A model system confirmed the high efficiency of the forward and reverse nitroaldol processes, forming dynamic polymers with intricate topologies.\n\nCrosslinking of the trialdehyde and dinitroalkanes was performed in DMSO, and the gelation process was studied chemically and mechanically. Optimal gelation was observed with certain dinitroalkanes and in specific solvents, with DMSO being chosen due to its short gelation time and high stability. The gelation time varied with feed concentration, catalyst loading, and temperature, demonstrating the influence of these parameters on the gel's formation.\n\nThe synthesized organogels were found to be insoluble in water, retaining their integrity upon drying and recovering their gel form upon exposure to DMSO. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy confirmed the consumption of aldehyde groups and formation of hydroxyls, as well as the persistence of nitro groups in the product. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed three stages in the degradation of the dried polymer: evaporation of water, pyrolysis of polyalcohols, and decomposition of residual hydrocarbons.\n\nOverall, this research highlights the potential of the nitroaldol reaction in creating dynamic covalent gels with tailored properties, offering a promising approach for developing new functional materials and addressing challenges faced by conventional crosslinked polymers."

            "input_text": "results show that the obtained crosslinked, dried polymers are thermally stable under normal, lower temperature conditions, but decompose at elevated temperatures due to the nature of the formed nitroalcohols. The self-healing behavior of the formed gels was tested by cutting one piece of gel **3d** into two halves (**Figure 5a-b**), after which the two separate gels were gently put together and kept at room temperature overnight without adding any additional reagents (**Figure 5c**). As shown in **Figure 5d**, the sliced parts fused into one piece, thereby mending the wound caused by the blade. Upon stretching, the healed gel maintained its general shape without breaking. In addition, angular frequency sweeping rheology analysis on gel **3d** (**Figure 5c**) before and after self-healing revealed that both gels showed storage moduli much larger than the loss moduli (_G'_>>_G\"_) and that the storage moduli (_G'_) were independent of the frequency at 0-100 rad/s, which is typical for elastic solids.[81] However, compared to the original gel, _G'_ decreased slightly in the healed gel while _G\"_ increased, indicating good mechanical strength but slightly higher viscous response due to the damage. These results demonstrate the excellent self-healing ability of the nitroaldol-crosslinked organogels. The dynamic nitroaldol reaction thus contributed to fusing the two separate gels, with the additional diffusion of solvents and polymer chains in the materials.[18, 22] However, both gels showed breakage when the shear frequency was higher than 160 rad/s due to the limitation of their strength (Figure S13). The reversible nature of the dynamic nitroaldol reaction renders the crosslinked polymers inherently degradable.[1, 5] To demonstrate this, gel **3d** was submerged into nitromethane with additional Et\\({}_{3}\\)N, and the gel integrity was followed. Rapid degradation was observed, and the gel disappeared within 30 min at r.t. even without stirring (Figure S14). After removing the volatiles, the residue was analyzed by 'H-NMR spectroscopy (**Figure 6b**). Signals corresponding to a trinitroalcohol (**6**, \\(\\Diamond\\), Figure S6) and 1,6-dinitrohexane (**2d**, \\(\\triangle\\)) appeared in the spectrum, revealing that the gel had been digested to small molecules through the reversible reaction. This demonstrates the excellent dynamicity and recyclability of the crosslinked nitroaldol polymers. ## Conclusions In summary, crosslinked dynamers of network topology in the form of organogels have been synthesized from a trialdehyde and a range of dinitroalkanes through the nitroaldol reaction for the first time. The gelation process could be controlled by adjusting the starting materials, Figure 5: a)–d) Self-healing test on gel **3d**; e) oscillatory rheology profile of gel **3d** before and after self-healing (original (\\(\\blacksquare\\)), healed (\\(\\blacktriangle\\)), storage modulus G’ (blue), loss modulus G” (orange)). where a distinct odd-even dependency of the dinitroalkane components was identified. The gel formation could also be tuned by adjusting the reaction conditions with respect to solvent, temperature, concentration, and catalyst loading. Under optimal conditions, rapid gelation times within a few minutes were recorded. The obtained dynamic covalent gels demonstrated fair mechanical and good thermal stability, and displayed excellent self-healing ability, responsiveness, and degradability. These results showcase a proof-of-concept for dynamic polymer crosslinking using the nitroaldol reaction. This constitutes a new approach to responsive and adaptive network structures, especially self-healable, degradable and recyclable three-dimensional materials. Thus, polymerization, crosslinking, reconstitution, depolymerization, and recycling of the crosslinked polymers can be easily achieved, thanks to the efficient dynamicity of the nitroaldol reaction. This study also expands the scope of dynameric materials in general, and our expectations are that such structures, in addition to the many applications already demonstrated, will help addressing some of the challenges experienced by conventional polymers.",
            "output_text": "The investigation revealed that the crosslinked and dried polymers created exhibit remarkable thermal stability under normal, low-temperature conditions, yet they decompose at elevated temperatures due to the inherent properties of the generated nitroalcohols. The self-healing capacity of the formed gels was experimentally assessed by cleaving a section of gel \"3d\" into two halves (Figure 5a and b). Subsequently, the separated parts were reunited and left at room temperature overnight without any extra reagents, demonstrating the gel's ability to regenerate (Figure 5c). Upon stretching, the healed gel maintained its integrity without fracturing, verifying its self-healing property. The rheological analysis (Figure 5c) confirmed that the healed gel had a storage modulus significantly higher than the loss modulus, characterized by $G' > G''$, and showed independence of storage modulus from frequency up to 100 rad/s, typical of elastic solids.\n\nThe dynamic nitroaldol reaction was responsible for fusing the two halves of the gel, facilitated by the diffusion of solvents and polymer chains within the material. However, the gels exhibited failure at shear frequencies above 160 rad/s, reflecting their strength limitations (Figure S13). The reversibility of the reaction implies the inherent degradability of the crosslinked polymers. A demonstration of this degradability was provided by immersing gel \"3d\" in nitromethane with Et${}_3$N, which resulted in rapid degradation and the disappearance of the gel within 30 minutes at room temperature (Figure S14). Post-decomposition analysis using 'H-NMR spectroscopy (Figure 6b) confirmed the conversion of the gel to trinitroalcohol (compound 6, marked with $\\Diamond$) and 1,6-dinitrohexane (compound 2d, marked with $\\triangle$), confirming the dynamicity and recyclability of the nitroaldol-crosslinked polymers.\n\nIn conclusion, this study introduced for the first time the synthesis of nitroaldol-crosslinked organogels with network topology as a result of a dynamic reaction involving a trialdehyde and various dinitroalkanes.

The resulting gels possessed mechanical robustness, thermal stability, self-healing capabilities, responsiveness, and degradability. This novel approach to dynamic polymer crosslinking through the nitroaldol reaction holds promise for the development of responsive and adaptable three-dimensional materials with applications beyond conventional polymers.

            "input_text": "###### Abstract The correct interpretation of the result from a point-of-care device is crucial for an accurate and rapid diagnosis and to guide subsequent treatment. Lateral flow tests (LFTs) use a well-established format that was designed to simplify the user experience. However, the LFT device architecture is inherently limited to detecting analytes that can be captured by molecular recognition. Microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (\\(\\upmu\\)PADs), like LFTs, have the potential to be used in diagnostic applications at the point of care. However, \\(\\upmu\\)PADs have not gained significant traction outside of academic laboratories, in part, because they have often demonstrated a lack of homogeneous shape or color in signal outputs, which consequently can lead to inaccurate interpretation of results by users. Here, we demonstrate a new class of \\(\\upmu\\)PADs that generate colorimetric signals at the interfaces of converging liquid fronts (i.e., lines) to control where colorimetric signals are formed without relying on capture techniques. We demonstrate our approach by developing assays for three classes of analytes--an ion, an enzyme, and a small molecule--using iron (III), acetylcholinesterase, and lactate, respectively. Additionally, we show these devices have the potential to support multiplexed assays by generating multiple lines in a common readout zone. These results highlight the ability of this new paper-based device architecture to aid the interpretation of assays that create soluble products by using flow to constrain those colorimetric products in a familiar, line-format output. ## Introduction Lateral flow test (LFT) strips have achieved widespread success in performing diagnostic tests at the point of care (POC) because their common architecture supports the development of a variety of immunoassay formats, utilizes scalable manufacturing processes to facilitate production and dissemination, and enables the interpretation of assay results by visual inspection. Nonetheless, the lateral flow device architecture largely limits testing to analytes that can be captured by immobilized molecular recognition agents (e.g., antibodies[1] or nucleic acids[2]) and testing is predominantly qualitative (i.e., presence or absence of a test line), both of which inherently restrict how broadly LFTs can be applied as a platform for POC measurements[3, 4]. As an alternative to LFTs, paper-based microfluidic devices or microfluidic paper analytical devices (\\(\\upmu\\)PAD) have drawn appeal due to their potential to support a broader test menu than LFTs (e.g., cell counts, nucleic acid amplification, immunoassay)[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], compatibility with a wide range of assay readout methods (e.g., colorimetric, fluorescent, electrochemical, chemiluminescent)[11, 12, 13, 14, 15], ability to support device complexity (e.g., evaporative concentration, origami or \"pop-up\" assemblies, and fluid control valves)[5, 16, 17, 18] and utilize creative options for generating a user interface (e.g., wicking distance, timed readout, zones filled, and text appearance)[19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. The first paper-based microfluidic device, and similarly many subsequent prototypes, demonstrated the detection of analytes (e.g., glucose and albumin) using chemistries that formed soluble colorimetric reaction products within the void volume of patterned paper zones[12]. However, unlike litmus paper or urine dipstick tests, colorimetric products in \\(\\upmu\\)PADs can have a non-uniform distribution within the test zone, which is caused either by unoptimized storage conditions (e.g., \"coffee-ring effect\" from dried reagents) or issues with balancing product diffusion or net fluid flow (i.e., by wicking)[24, 25, 26]. Heterogeneous signals in test zones, regardless of whether devices are designed to be operated in two- or three-dimensional configurations, can result in interpretation errors, particularly when printed read guides are presented with colors that are uniform in hue and spatial position[27]. A variety of strategies have been developed to address challenges related to the position and distribution of colorimetric signals in patterned paper zones. For assay formats that require molecular recognition, incorporation of nylon[10] or nitrocellulose[28] membranes into device designs can support reagent immobilization by physisorption and capture of analytes under continuous flow. Alternatively, the surfaces of cellulosic paper fibers can be functionalized chemically[29, 30, 31] or biochemically (e.g., via engineered proteins)[32, 33] to support the immobilization of reagents.[34, 35] Detection reagents can also be crosslinked throughout the open pore structure of a paper substrate to create an immobilized network of materials that would otherwise diffuse throughout the paper architecture.[36, 37] While these approaches provide assay developers with a variety of device design options, they each require target analytes to be captured or reagent-specific functionalization strategies to restrict the formation of a colorimetric signal to a defined location. To generate spatially-controlled, colorimetric signals without the requirements for molecular recognition or reagent immobilization, we developed a new class of paper-based microfluidic devices that form and confine colorimetric signals to the interfaces of converging liquid fronts (Figure 1A). The fluidic network patterned into the device splits a single sample inlet into separate and ultimately opposing channels. Analytes can undergo partial reactions with unique reagents stored in each channel. The products of these partial reactions are directed towards a common test zone. Others have shown paper devices designed for the sequential, timed delivery of reagents from multiple channels that are directed towards a test zone.[38, 39] In these devices, flow is continuous as long as sufficient volume is available to saturate the paper. Because paper-based devices are inherently self-metering,[5] if a single channel is split and recombined, net fluid flow stops when the advancing fluid fronts meet. At this interface between fronts, where reactions between previously separated reagents are now possible and controlled by diffusion, assay products can be isolated without affinity-based capture and lead to the formation of colorimetric signals that are confined to the contour of the interface. Using this device design strategy, we demonstrate the detection of multiple classes of analytes--ions, small molecules, and enzymes--by producing line-format signals like those provided by LFTs but resulting from soluble reaction products. We demonstrate our approach by developing assays for iron (III), acetylcholinesteraseiesterase, and lactate. Additionally, we demonstrate the scalability of this method by increasing the number of fluid fronts that converge in a common detection zone to create multiplexed assays: two converging channels create one interface (i.e., singleplex) while three or four converging channels create three or four interfaces, respectively (i.e., multiplex). We demonstrate the ability to create multiple lines in common zone by combining test and control assays for both iron (III) and acetylcholinesteraseiesterase. Overall, these devices provide a new method of generating user-friendly signal formats for analytes that are currently incompatible with molecular recognition-style assay architectures. ## Results and discussion ### Device Design Considerations The properties and quantities of reagents stored within paper layers determine rehydration times and the rates at which they wick through the device and toward the ultimate detection zone [39, 40]. For assays that require reagents with different chemical properties (e.g., solubility, rehydration rate, or interactions with the surrounding paper matrix) to be stored on opposite sides of the device, channel lengths may be adjusted to provide timed convergence of liquid fronts at the desired location [11, 41]. This approach is shown in Figure S1A, in which an interface formed between two solutions of colored dyes was shifted from the center of the device detection zone using an asymmetrical channel geometry. Additionally, the position of the formed interface is dependent on the geometries of patterned paper layer features and proper layer alignment [42, 43]. We developed a layer alignment pin tool and protocol to position device features reproducibly and ensure the interface position is only dependent on synchronized delivery of fluid fronts to the detection zone (Figure S2). This approach consistently provides interfaces at the center of device detection zones (Figure S1B). In the assays described below, a symmetrical channel design reproducibly afforded interfaces in the center of the test zone. While evaluating the reproducibility of signal formation in these three-dimensional devices, we noticed that the background color intensity of the detection zones was influenced by the wax pattern from the preceding layer (reagent storage) now being visualized through the wet, semi-transparent zone. In other three-dimensional paper-based device designs [10], output zones are typically backed by patterned paper channels, which are white in color to provide color contrast. In these interface-forming devices, however, detection zones are not in direct, vertical fluidic connection with patterned features on the previous layer. To enhance the contrast between colorimetric signal at liquid interfaces and the surrounding paper matrix, we altered our device design to include a patterned paper zone in the center of the reagent storage layer (Table S1) that is separate from the fluidic pathway of the assay and stays dry. ### Analyte detection strategy These paper devices perform assays through multistep or partial-step chemical reactions that are carried out in opposing channels but from a single sample input. The resultant colorimetric signal only forms when the advancing liquid fronts converge, and reagents and intermediate products can react by diffusing across the formed interface. In the single-analyte detection format, reagents are stored within the device such that one channel contains analyte-specific reagents, and the other channel contains a product-specific indicator. Upon introduction of the sample, a partial reaction occurs in the channel containing analyte-specific reagents. As the two liquid fronts converge, the assay is completed by reaction between the formed product and the product-specific indicator. Thus, a colorimetric interfacial signal develops in the readout zone and the signal is confined in the interface contour due to reaction specificity and timed transport of solutions. ### Quantifying interface signal We performed signal analysis using ImageJ.[44] To analyze signal intensity at the interface, we either (i) used the \"Plot Profile\" tool and analyzed the pixel intensity across the circular signal readout region or (ii) defined the interfacial signal using the \"Rectangle\" tool and then performed \"RGB Measure\" analysis using the available plugin. The time required to generate visible signals can vary based on the grade of paper used to fabricate the device (Table S2). We used Whatman 4 for all layers of our paper-based device and observed that signal formation starts at approximately 2 minutes. Products accumulate over time and cause an increase in signal intensity, until saturating at approximately 7 minutes after the sample was added (Figure 2A). Additionally, the gradual increase in signal intensity causes nearly linear broadening of the width of the formed interface over time, which eventually compromises signal intensity. Therefore, we determined the ideal signal read time is between 7-10 minutes, with the cut off time for signal interpretation to be 20 minutes. Prior to the cut off time, the signal intensity is at a maximum value and can be used for qualitative detection, which we demonstrate with Fe(III) ions (Figure 2B). Signal intensities at 2 minutes and 100 minutes resulted in similar intensity values (data not shown). Longer times lead to diminishing signal intensity due to diffusion of product. ### Iron (Fe(III)) For the representative ion assay, we selected Fe(III). Iron homeostasis is vital to multiple biological processes (e.g., oxygen transport and short-term oxygen storage) and the concentration of iron can be used as a diagnostic marker for anemia.[45] We chose Fe(III) as a model analyte to highlight two key functions of our device: (i) the separation of reduction and chelation reactions and (ii) the spatial confinement of low molecular weight products. To detect Fe(III), we stored ascorbic acid (a reducing agent) and 3-(2-pyridyl)-5,6-diphenyl-1,2,4-triazine-p,p'-disulfonic acid (Ferrozine; a colorimetric indicator of Fe(II))[46] in opposite channels of the reagent storage layer (Figure 3A). When a sample is added to the device, it is split uniformly intoeach channel where it rehydrates and can react with these stored reagents. If Fe(III) is present in the sample, it will be reduced to Fe(II) in the channel containing ascorbic acid, while no reactions will occur in the channel containing Ferrozine. When the two wicking fronts converge at the detection zone on the bottom layer of the device, reduced Fe(II) is chelated by Ferrozine and forms a purple signal at the formed interface (Figure 3B, Figure S4). In some experiments, we observed a noticeable background signal in the channel containing Ferrozine that scaled with the concentration of added Fe(III) (Figure S5). The presence of this background color could negatively impact the performance of the Fe(III) assay (i.e., reduced specificity and increased limit of detection). This color, a reaction product with Ferrozine, could be caused by Fe(II) impurities in either the Fe(III) sample or the paper[47]. We minimized the background signal by incorporating ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in the Ferrozine side of the sample distribution layer[48]. We tested both the effect of different EDTA and Ferrozine concentrations on the signal to background ratio (Table S3, Table S4). As the concentration of Ferrozine increased, the intensities of both the signal formed at the readout zone and the background increased. The increase in background intensity did not negatively impact the signal to background ratio, which increased proportionally with the concentration",

The innovative approach presented addresses this issue by generating colorimetric signals at the interfaces of converging liquid fronts, eliminating the need for capture mechanisms.\n\nThe authors develop μPADs for three classes of analytes: an ion (iron (III)), an enzyme (acetylcholinesterase), and a small molecule (lactate), demonstrating their versatility.

The generated colorimetric signals appear at the interface where the reacting liquids meet, providing a clear, line-format output that aids in interpretation.\n\nThe performance of the μPADs is characterized by the time it takes for color to form, which is around 2 minutes for the devices made with Whatman 4 paper. The optimal reading time is between 7-10 minutes to maximize signal intensity for qualitative detection.

            "input_text": "of Ferrozine. However, the increase in signal to background ratio in the presence of EDTA was higher than that without using EDTA, which further suggests that the incorporation of EDTA provided superior results (Table S3, Table S4). The addition of samples containing Fe(III) resulted in interfaces with colors whose intensities correlated linearly with concentration between 5.8-13.0 mM and had an LOD of 2.9 mM (Figure 3C). We chose this range of concentrations as it corresponds to the biologically relevant concentration of total iron that could be liberated from hemoglobin[49]. While quantitative analysis is useful to characterize assay performance as changes are made to reagent conditions for device design, ultimately, we envision the application of this approach to be similar to how LFTsoperate--using the formation (or absence) of a line as a qualitative indicator of the presence (or absence) of an analyte (Figure 3D). ### Acetylcholinesteraseterase (AChE) For the representative enzyme assay, we selected AChE. AChE hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into choline and acetic acid to terminate neurotransmission at the cholinergic synapse. Inhibition of AChE by organophosphates, heavy metals, or chemical warfare agents can block acetylcholine transmission and lead to organ failure and death [50]. We chose AChE as a model analyte to evaluate how interfaces were formed when reactions were governed by two time-dependent processes: (i) the activity of the enzyme (i.e., the analyte) and (ii) diffusion and mixing of reactants across the interface. To detect AChE, we stored acetylcholine chloride and 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB, Ellman's reagent) on opposite sides of the reagent storage layer (Figure S6). When AChE is present in the added sample, it reacts with acetylcholine to produce acetic acid and thiocholine (Figure 4A). At the interface, the unmasked sulfhydryl group on the thiocholine interacts with DTNB to generate 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoic acid and form a yellow signal that we could quantify with image analysis. As expected for an enzymatic assay, the signal intensities saturated over time. Similar to the Fe(III) assay, signal from AChE assay took approximately two minutes to start forming and increased in width and intensity over time. To ensure color saturation, we used the scans taken 10 minutes after sample addition to analyze the signal intensity formed at the interface. We performed nonlinear regression of the data using a saturation growth model for concentrations of AChE ranging from 2-30 U/mL (Figure 4B). From the fit, we determined that there was a nearly linear relationship between the concentration of AChE and measured signal between 2-10 U/mL, and signals at higher concentrations were saturated and could be detected but not quantified. While the physiological range of AChE in plasma is greater than 8 U/mL [51], exposure to dangerous chemical agents (e.g., organophosphates) results in a reduction of AChE activity into the linear range of this assay. While it can be hard to detect yellow lines on white backgrounds with the naked eye, especially at lower analyte concentrations, this AChE assay remains useful to provide a visual reference for qualitative detection (i.e., \"yes or no\" presence of analyte). Given the versatility of our device design, it is possible to substitute assay reagents (i.e., other colorimetric substrates)[50] for AChE to enhance signal contrast. ### Lactate For the representative small molecule assay, we selected lactate. Lactate is an intermediate in the metabolic anerobic carbohydrate pathway whose concentration in sweat changes with exercise. While exercising, undesired lactate accumulation in the active muscle can manifest as fatigue, soreness, and pain[52]. Also, sweat lactate can provide information about insufficient oxidative metabolism and pressure ischemia[53]. We chose lactate as a model analyte to demonstrate how the device can accommodate multistep reactions. To detect lactate, we stored (i) nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and (ii) 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolzolium bromide (MTT) on opposite sides of the second layer of the device (Figure 5A). Then on the third layer, we again stored NAD+/LDH below the first treated layer and phenazine methosulfate (PMS) below MTT (Figure S7). When a sample containing lactate is introduced and split by the sample distribution layer, the following reactions occur: (i) LDH converts lactate to pyruvate and (ii) transfers the liberated hydride ion to the co-stored NAD+ to produce NADH. In the other channel, both MTT and PMS are simply rehydrated. When the split sample converges at the interface, PMS mediates an electron transfer from NADH to reduce MTT and produce a purple-colored formazan product. For stable reagent storage and optimal performance, we tested different configurations of device layers, layer treatments, and drying conditions (i.e., light and temperature). From initial trials, we determined it is necessary to spatially separate PMS and MTT for reagent storage stability and to perform all manufacturing steps in the dark at room temperature. The addition of hydrazine buffer on the fourth layer of the device was to neutralize the co-produced pyruvate (Figure S7)[54]. For the lactate assay, the detected concentration range was 2-50 mM (Figure 5B). Unlike Fe(lll) and AChE assays, we analyzed results of lactate assay approximately 4 minutes after sample addition to avoid increased background signal over time. The high noise is likely due to both MTT and PMS reagents causing a yellow background color. Since the assay involves enzymatic reactions, we analyzed the results by nonlinear regression using a growth and saturation model. The data showed a nearly linear relationship between signal intensity (green channel) at concentrations of lactate less than 20 mM. At higher concentrations of lactate, the signal saturated and resulted in detectable but not quantifiable signal (Figure 5C). The nearly linear range of measurement is useful to quantify lactate in sweat, which decreases from 31 mM at the start of exercising to 12 mM at the point of exhaustion[53]. ### Multiplexed detection In Figure 1, we demonstrated that it was possible to design a device such that multiple, independent channels (i.e., 3-4) could converge in a common zone to create multiple interfaces. While this preliminary experiment was performed with dyes stored in the device and rehydrated only with water, the results showed several useful features that were analogous to the singleplex format: (i) equal channel lengths and design symmetry could control the position of interfaces in a common zone, (ii) mixing only occurs across interfaces formed from advancing fronts, and (iii) net flow stops when the read zone is filled to allow reactions to be confined only to formed interfaces. As a result, we evaluated the potential to create multiplexed assays using the interface device design by combining two of the aforementioned singleplex assays. Taking inspiration from a standard LFT, which comprises a single test line and single control line, we aimed to demonstrate the ability of our devices to support multiple test and control lines in the same read zone. We chose to develop an assay for Fe(lll) and AChE, which would produce four interfacial signals: one test line and one control line for each respective analyte. Figure S8 depicts the conditions that introduce assay reagents into their required spatial locations (layer and channel). One major difference from the singleplex assays is that control interfaces require the storage and eventual introduction of the partial reaction products formed in the test interfaces--namely, ferrous iron (FeCl\\({}_{2}\\)) and a free thiol (cysteine)--to react with stored indicators. After all four channels wick through to the final layer, the four resulting liquid fronts converge at the detection zone and form four interfacial signals. At the detection zone, a yellow interface formed at position 1 indicates the presence of AChE, a yellow interface formed at position 2 indicates the corresponding control line for AChE, a purple interface formed at position 3 indicates the presence of control line for Fe(III), and finally, a purple interface formed at position 4 indicates the presence of Fe(III). The resulting outputs for all possible combinations of analytes (positive and negative for each, with corresponding controls) are shown on Figure 6. ## Conclusions In this manuscript, we report a new class of paper-based microfluidic devices that uses converging liquid fronts to constrain the location where assay chemistries are performed within test zones. Like the ubiquitous lateral flow test, which serve as an inspiration for the readout format of these devices, the shape of the colorimetric assay product is a line. We made this design decision to facilitate how assay results are interpreted[55], either qualitatively or quantitively. Unlike lateral flow tests, however, these paper devices do not rely on molecular recognition or affinity capture to immobilize analytes of interest or colorimetric reagents. Instead, by converging and halting two opposing wicking fronts, the location of soluble reaction products can be defined. While we show the potential for this device format to support colorimetric assays for Fe(III), acetylcholinesterasecholinesterase, and lactate, we believe that similar applications are possible for other analytes represented by these classes (i.e., ions, enzymes, and small molecules). In addition to singleplex assays for each of these analytes, we further demonstrate that multiplexed assays--where multiple fluid fronts carrying distinct reaction products and/orindicators--can be supported by this approach to form interfaces in paper test zones. Unlike in singleplex assays, where efforts to optimize assay conditions and formulate reagents for storage within the device have relatively limited variables, the creation of multiplexed assays requires deliberate attention to reagent compatibility and cross-reactivity to limit false positives and negatives. Even so, the opportunity to integrate positive controls, which are frequently missing from assays developed for paper-based microfluidic devices, would address a major requirement for point-of-care tests. Beyond their use as procedural controls, we anticipate that the intensities of these lines may have the potential to be used as visual comparators to estimate the concentration of the analyte in the sample. In total, the unique design of these devices has the potential to simplify the user experience and interpretation of critical results at the point-of-use, while broadening the analytical capabilities and ultimate utility of paper-based microfluidic sensors.",
            "output_text": "In this study, the authors introduced a novel paper-based microfluidic platform that utilizes converging liquid fronts to confine chemical reactions within specific testing zones, akin to lateral flow tests. This design, inspired by the ease of interpretation in lateral flow tests, enables the formation of colorimetric signals that indicate the presence or absence of analytes. Unlike conventional lateral flow tests, the device does not rely on molecular recognition or capture, but rather relies on the physical interaction of opposing wicking fronts to define the reaction zone.\n\nThe efficacy of the device was showcased through the analysis of two representative analytes: ferric ions (Fe(III)) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The presence of EDTA improved the signal-to-background ratio, suggesting enhanced performance. For Fe(III), the color intensity correlated linearly with concentration between 5.8-13.0 mM and had a limit of detection (LOD) of 2.9 mM, demonstrating its suitability for detecting biologically relevant levels. For AChE, the enzyme activity and diffusion were simultaneously measured, leading to a saturating yellow signal that could be quantified with image analysis.\n\nLactate, another small molecule, was used as a model to demonstrate the device's adaptability to multistep reactions. By incorporating NAD+ and lactate dehydrogenase, and a colorimetric substrate like MTT, a purple signal was generated upon reaction with lactate. The device's sensitivity for lactate ranged from 2-50 mM, with nonlinear regression showing a near-linear relationship at lower concentrations.\n\nMultiplexed detection was also demonstrated, where three or four independent channels merged in a common zone, creating multiple interfaces. By combining Fe(III) and AChE assays, four distinct lines were formed at the detection zone, allowing for simultaneous testing and control lines. The device's design allowed for careful consideration of reagent compatibility and cross-reactivity to minimize false positives and negatives in multiplexed assays.\n\nThe conclusions highlight the potential of this paper-based microfluidic device to simplify user interaction and interpretation of results, expanding the analytical capabilities of these devices for various analytes, including ions, enzymes, and small molecules. The integration of positive controls is particularly noteworthy, as it addresses a crucial aspect often missing in point-of-care tests. The device's unique design promises to enhance the usability and practicality of paper-based microfluidics in various diagnostic applications."

            "input_text": "## Results and Discussion We first tested the effects of this molecule in the synthesis of the widely researched MIL-53(Al)[37] (chemical formula Al(OH)bdc; bdc=1,4-benzendicarboxylate) and compared its efficacy, under equal synthetic conditions, with those of other modulators, namely HCI, HF, NH_eF, and sodium oxalate. This choice allowed us to decouple the effects of acidity and coordination modulation and to evaluate the advantages of our approach over the already established use of HF. Whereas the increase of H\\({}_{3}\\)O\\({}^{*}\\) concentration has positive effects on the crystallinity in general, the -10 \\(\\upmu\\)m average crystal size observed by using HCI increases 4-fold with HF and 8-fold with oxalic acid (Figure 1a, Figures S3-S8), suggesting that the anion's coordinative capabilities have the most significant influence. However, in the case of fluoride modulation, the crystal size was not the only observed change as X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) patterns show the presence of a secondary phase (Figure 1b). This is supported by the appearance of a secondary combustion process in the thermogravimetric profiles (Figure S37). These differences agree with the formation of a fluorine-substituted form of MIL-53, Al(F)bdc, whose properties differ significantly from those of the fluorine-free material, especially concerning its renowned breathing behaviour[38]. This compound, first reported by Liu et al[39], has also been observed as impurity in a recent paper on the use of HF to increase the crystallinity of MIL-53[31]. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis on rinsed product obtained by HF-modulated synthesis shows that all the observed crystals are contaminated with fluoride inclusions (Figures 1c and S36). This evidence indicates that Al(F)bdc is present as crystalline domains within MIL-53 crystals rather than as a pure phase. This is further corroborated by the absence of structured diffuse scattering in high-resolution SCXRD data from contaminated crystals (Figures S54-S55)[40, 41]. Additionally, a minor fraction of the crystals exhibit a higher density of aluminium and fluorine, in line with the previously reported presence of undesired AlF\\({}_{3}\\) (Figure 1c, Figure S36, and Table S3)[32]. Considering all the evidence, it can be concluded that the use of fluoride modulation in MIL-53 synthesis yields crystals with inclusions of Al(F)bdc, and AlF\\({}_{3}\\) as by-product. The oxalate-modulated syntheses, on the other hand, yielded pure MIL-53 crystals as evidenced by XRPD analysis (Figure 1b). Their thermogravimetric profiles show no sign of oxalate species in the framework or missing linker defects (Figure S37). Moreover, nitrogen sorption measurements show no substantial difference, in terms of BET surface area and pore volume, between the unmodulated and the oxalic acid-modulated products (Figure 1d). By comparison, the products obtained by using HF show instead a loss of BET area and pore volume of approximately 10%. Since this difference is mainly attributable to the presence of impurities of non-porous AlF\\({}_{3}\\) in the sample (-4.5% w/w calculated from the TGA profile), it is not possible to assess with precision the effects of the fluoride inclusions in the MIL-53 framework based on the sorption behaviour. Nevertheless, these results further demonstrate the detrimental effects of fluoride-based synthesis modulation and the capability of oxalic acid to increase the MOF's crystallinity without causing compositional modifications. The main reason for these effects can be found in the characteristic x\\({}^{2}\\) chelation mode of oxalic acid and the high stability of the resulting five-membered ring (Scheme 2a). The participation of oxalate in the framework would require it either to adopt a poorly stable \\(\\upmu\\)-1,3 coordination using only one of its Figure 1: (a) SEM micrographs of MIL-53 crystals obtained by normal and modulated syntheses (scale bar = 10 \\(\\upmu\\)m). XRPD (b) and EDX analysis (c) show the presence of Al(F)bdc (marked \\({}^{*}\\)) and AlF\\({}_{3}\\) when a fluoride-based modulator is used. (d) N\\({}_{2}\\) adsorption (empty circles) and desorption (filled circles) isotherms showing a decrease of BET area and pore volume for HF-modulated MIL-53. carboxylate groups or to bridge the aluminium centers using both groups (i.e., \\(\\mu_{2}\\)-1,4 bridging), which is incompatible with the MIL-53 structure both in terms of charge and IBU coordination geometry. This is further supported by the absence of both types of oxalate-aluminium coordination geometries in the CSD database (see Supporting Information, page 27)[42]. On the contrary, fluoride coordination to aluminium is fully compatible with the substitution of hydroxy groups in the framework since both anions are monodentate, have analogous size, and feature same charge and number of valence electron pairs (Scheme 2b). For similar reasons, the use of short-chain monocarboxylic acids as synthesis modulators should be considered only in cases where inducing linker-replacement defects is pursued, as evidenced by previous studies[43, 44]. The benefits of oxalic acid modulation are not limited to MIL-53, as they were also observed for its analogues with OH-, CH\\({}_{3}\\)O-, Br-, and NO\\({}_{2}\\)-functionalised linkers. These MOFs were synthesized using 0.5, 1, and 1.5 oxalic acid:Al ratios to study how the amount of modulator affects the crystallinity of the products. In all the studied systems, oxalic acid leads to an increased crystal size with respect to the unmodulated synthesis (Figure 2, Figures S9-S23). Interestingly, a higher modulator-to-Al ratio does not always result in improved crystallinity. Indeed, in the cases of OH- and CH\\({}_{3}\\)O-MIL-53, an excessive amount of modulator leads to the stabilisation of a specific size or the absence of solid products, respectively. This behaviour can be attributed to the electron-donor character of OH and CH\\({}_{3}\\)O groups[45], which lowers the acidity of terephthalatic acid by destabilising its conjugated base[46]. Additionally, the pH decrease due to the MOF synthesis and to the formation of aluminium oxalate complexes further disfavours the deprotonation of the linkers, thus diminishing their reactivity. Our results show that the combination of these effects can allow for the tuning of the product's size distribution, in addition to its crystallinity. However, to achieve such control several aspects should be considered, in particular the modulator concentration, the species formed during the synthesis, and the chemical properties of the linker. Therefore, the adequate conditions to stabilize a specific size must be optimised for every system. A peculiar behaviour is observed for NO\\({}_{2}\\)-MIL-53, whose crystal quality improves with the use of modulator but drops significantly when a modulator:Al ratio of 1.5 is used. The XRPD patterns of all NO\\({}_{2}\\)-MIL-53 products (Figure S48) show broad diffuse scattering bands, also observed by SCXRD (Figure S56). These signals are attributable to a local ordering of the NO\\({}_{2}\\) groups, which can be found disordered in four equivalent positions for every linker after the MOF assembly. The effect of the modulator in slowing the crystal growth can favour this ordering and allow the formation of larger ordered domains, which could grow clustered in polycrystalline aggregates like those observed by SEM for the products obtained with the highest modulator concentration. Further experiments to confirm this hypothesis and determine the ordering of the NO\\({}_{2}\\) groups will be the focus of our future research. Having confirmed the effectiveness of oxalic acid in the synthesis of functionalised MIL-53, we extended its use to additional AI-MOFs with varying linker molecules and IBUs, namely CAU-10[47], MIL-69[48], and AI(OH)ndc[49] (ndc = 1,4-nophtalenedactorabytate). These three materials were obtained as nanocrystalline powders by conventional synthesis, whereas the introduction of oxalic acid modulation afforded crystals up to 5 \\(\\upmu\\)m for CAU-10, 20 \\(\\upmu\\)m for MIL-69, and 70 \\(\\upmu\\)m for AI(OH)ndc (Figure 2, Figures S24-S35). Although the performance of the modulator depends strongly on the type of material, the oxalic acid modulation method proved its validity on these systems despite their different structure and assembly. Even in the case of the notably different linker geometry and IBU structure of CAU-10, the kinetic control introduced by oxalic acid coordination to the metals improves the crystallinity while limiting the occurrence of crystal twinning and the formation of intergrown domains. ## Conclusions In conclusion, the use of oxalic acid as synthesis modulator for various AI-MOFs affords products with an unprecedented crystallinity without affecting the materials' structure and composition. Although the outcome of this approach is highly dependent on the framework's structure as well as on the synthetic conditions, its efficacy has been confirmed for all the examined systems regardless of linker functionalisation or type of material. We attribute this remarkable versatility to oxalic acid's synergistic action in both binding the metals and protonating the linkers, thus introducing a substantial control over the MOF nucleation and regulating the crystal growth. Furthermore, we described how the strong differences between its characteristic five-membered ring chelation and the linker's coordination mode in the studied materials allow the modulating function without causing substitutional defects. These advantages do not apply in the case of modulators whose coordination capabilities are compatible with those found in the IBUs, such as fluoride or monocarboxylate species. Further applications of oxalic acid modulation to other AI-MOFs, as well as frameworks based on different metals, will be crucial to assess more thoroughly its validity and highlight additional MOF-specific particularities and advantages associated with its use. ## Experimental Section ### Reagents and solvents All solvents and reagents, except for 2-methoxyrephtalic acid and sodium oxalate anhydrous, were purchased by commercial suppliers and used as-received. A complete list including purity and suppliers can be found in the Supporting Information. ### Synthesis of 2-methoxyrephtalic acid 2-methoxyrephtalic acid was synthesized according to a reported method.[59] A mixture of 2,5-dimethylanisole (7.76 g, 57 mmol), KMnO4 (25.0 g, 158 mmol), and NaOH (3.10 g, 77.5 mmol) in water (500 mL) was heated to 60 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C.

The liner was sealed inside a steel autoclave and placed in an oven at 220 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C for 72 hours. ### Synthesis of X-MIL-53 (X = CH\\({}_{2}\\)O, OH, Br, NO\\({}_{2}\\)) All reagent amounts and reaction temperatures are given in Table S1. A synthesis-specific amount of AICI\\({}_{3}\\)-6H\\({}_{2}\\)O was added to 30 ml demineralized H\\({}_{2}\\)O inside a 45 mL Teflon liner. Oxalic acid dihydrate was added in a specific stoichiometric amount and the solution was homogenised by stirring. An amount of linker in molar ratio 1:1 to AICI\\({}_{3}\\)-6H\\({}_{2}\\)O was added and the solution was stirred again. The liner was sealed inside a steel autoclave and placed in an oven at a given temperature for 72 hours. ### Synthesis of CAU-10 Four different syntheses were performed using a general procedure adapted from the one reported by Reinsch et al.[47] by using different amounts of oxalic acid: 0 mmol, 0.6 mmol (53 mg), 1.2 mmol (105 mg), and 1.8 mmol (158 mg). The general procedure is reported as follows. A\\({}_{2}\\)(SO\\({}_{3}\\))\\({}_{3}\\)-18H\\({}_{2}\\)O (802 mg, 1.2 mmol) was dissolved in 10 ml of a 1:4 DMF-H\\({}_{2}\\)O mixture in a 45 mL Teflon liner. A certain stoichiometric amount of oxalic acid dihydrate was added and the solution was homogenised by stirring. Isophthal acid (199 mg, 1.2 mmol) was added and the solution was stirred again. The liner was sealed inside a steel autoclave and placed in an oven at 135 \\({}^{\\circ}\\)C for 24 hours. ### Synthesis of MIL-69 Four different syntheses were performed using a general procedure adapted from the one reported by Loiseau et al.[48] by using different amounts of oxalic acid: 0 mmol, 1.75 mmol (221 mg), 3.5 mmol (441 mg),",
            "output_text": "## Results and Discussion\n\nOur initial investigation focused on assessing the impact of a specific molecule in the synthesis of MIL-53(Al)[37], a well-studied material with the chemical formula Al(OH)bdc, using standardized conditions. To differentiate the effects of acidity and coordination modulation, we compared its performance with other modulators such as hydrochloric acid (HCI), hydrofluoric acid (HF), ammonium fluoride (NH_eF), and sodium oxalate. By using these alternatives, we aimed to isolate the contribution of the anion's coordinating abilities.\n\nThe results revealed that increasing the concentration of H_3O^* generally improved crystallinity, with a 4-fold increase observed when using HF and an 8-fold increase with oxalic acid (Figure 1a, supplementary figures S3-S8). This indicated that the anion's coordination capabilities play a crucial role in crystallization. However, when fluoride was employed as a modulator, X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) patterns showed the presence of a secondary phase, suggesting the formation of Al(F)bdc, a fluoride-substituted variant of MIL-53 with distinct properties (Figure 1b, supplementary figure S37). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis confirmed the presence of fluoride and Al(F)bdc inclusions in the crystals (Figure 1c, supplementary figure S36).\n\nIn contrast, oxalic acid modulations led to pure MIL-53 crystals, as shown by XRPD patterns and thermogravimetric analyses, without detectable oxalate species or linker defects (Figure 1b, supplementary figure S37). Nitrogen sorption measurements demonstrated no significant changes in the material's surface area and pore volume between the unmodulated and oxalic acid-modified samples (Figure 1d). These findings suggested that oxalic acid effectively enhances crystallinity without altering the molecular composition.\n\nThe superior performance of oxalic acid could be attributed to its unique x^2 chelation mode and the stability of the resulting five-membered rings. This allowed oxalic acid to coordinate to aluminum without causing structural modifications, unlike fluoride, which can substitute hydroxy groups and introduce compositional changes. Similarly, short-chain monocarboxylic acids, while potentially effective in some cases, were only suitable for linker replacement defects, as observed for OH- and CH_3O-MIL-53.\n\nMoreover, we extended the use of oxalic acid to other AI-MOFs, including CAU-10, MIL-69, and AI(OH)ndc, with varying linkers and metal ion backbones. Oxalic acid was found to enhance the crystallinity of these materials, with the observed particle sizes increasing for CAU-10, MIL-69, and AI(OH)ndc (up to 5, 20, and 70 micrometers, respectively, from unmodulated synthesis) (Figure 2, supplementary figures S24-S35). Despite the material dependence, the oxalic acid modulation strategy proved effective in improving crystallinity across different structures.\n\nIn summary, the use of oxalic acid as a synthesis modulator offers unprecedented crystallinity in various AI-MOFs without compromising their original structure or composition. This is due to its synergistic effect in binding metals and protonating linkers, allowing for precise control over nucleation and crystal growth. The strong differences in its coordination mode compared to other modulators, such as fluoride, contribute to its effectiveness and versatility in MOF synthesis. Further research is needed to explore oxalic acid's potential in modulating other materials and to optimize the conditions for specific applications."

            "input_text": "## Abstract Quantum coherence of S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) transition metal-based quantum bits (qubits) is strongly influenced by the magnitude of spin-phonon coupling. While this coupling is recognized as deriving from dynamic distortions about the first coordination sphere of the metal, a general model for understanding and quantifying ligand field contributions has not been established. Here we derive a general ligand field theory model to describe and quantify the nature of spin-phonon coupling terms in S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) transition metal complexes. We show that the coupling term for a given vibrational mode is governed by: 1) the magnitude of the metal-based spin-orbit coupling constant, 2) the magnitude and gradient in the ligand field excited state energy, and 3) dynamic relativistic nephelauxetic contributions reflecting the magnitude and gradient in the covalency of the ligand-metal bonds.

While providing a fundamental framework and means to benchmark current qubits, the model and methodology described herein can be used to screen any S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) molecular qubit candidate and guide the discovery of room temperature coherent materials for quantum information processing. **1. Introduction.** The coupling of electron spin to phonons/vibrations plays important roles in the dynamical properties of transition metal complexes and materials. For example, spin-phonon coupling plays a major role in the photophysical and photochemical properties of transition metal complexes, including ultrafast spin state switching and intersystem crossing, wherein it provides a strong influence on nonequilibrium dynamics.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] It is also a major factor in the magnetization dynamics of single molecule magnets[6, 7, 8, 9] and coherent materials for quantum information science.[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16] Beyond molecular systems, spin-phonon coupling also plays important roles in extended solids and condensed matter (e.g., transition metal oxides) by giving rise to emergent phenomena such as colossal magnetoresistance and high \\(T_{C}\\) superconductivity,[17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22] including vibrational or optical control of these properties.[23, 24, 25, 26] Thus, fundamental studies of spin-phonon coupling can provide insights into a variety of research areas, and there are fascinating intersections between the nature of spin-phonon coupling in molecular systems (e.g., mononuclear, binuclear, and multinuclear transition metal complexes) and extended solids to be explored. Recent research has focused on the use of \\(\\mathrm{S=\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}}\\) transition metal complexes as quantum bits (qubits), as the magnetic field split electron spin sublevels (\\(\\mathrm{M_{s}=\\pm\\ 1/2}\\)) provide a two-level system in which a coherent superposition state can be formed. This coherent superposition state, often initiated with a well-defined microwave pulse sequence in an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer (\\(\\sim\\)9 or 35 GHz for X- or Q-band, respectively), can be leveraged to satisfy DiVincenzo's criteria for the physical implementation of a quantum computer.[27] However, the lifetime of this state must be significantly longer than the gate operation time, and a significant challenge in the domain of molecular qubits is to understand the principles controlling coherence lifetimes. This understanding can then be leveraged for the synthetic design of new transition metal complexes with long-lived coherent states. The quantities of measure to gauge different complexes are the spin-lattice relaxation time, \\(T_{I}\\), the spin-spin lattice relaxation time, \\(T_{2}\\), and the phase memory time, \\(T_{m}\\), which serves as an \"effective\" \\(T_{2}\\) often measured instead. Recent work has demonstrated the remarkable increase in \\(T_{2}\\) when minimizing the quantity of nuclear spins in the environment of the complex, inclusive of both solvent and the ligand set.[28] In these nuclear spin-free environments, \\(T_{I}\\) has proved to be the upper bound to coherence lifetimes, which further motivates efforts to better understand contributions to \\(T_{I}\\), including the role of the geometric and electronic structure of the transitionmetal complex.[28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44] Recent works in this area by Sessoli et al.[13, 44], Coronado et al.[14, 15], and Freedman et al.[33] have highlighted specific ligand field contributions to spin-phonon coupling and coherence dynamics. Additionally, \\(T_{I}\\) relaxation times will also play a major role when molecular qubits are entangled in dimers,[45, 46, 47, 48, 49] higher order complexes, or spin-dense arrays,[36] which will be required for the realization of quantum computing applications. While progress has been made experimentally in elongating \\(T_{I}\\) and \\(T_{m}\\) relaxation times of transition metal complexes at low temperatures (\\(<\\)80 K), very few metal complexes exhibit coherence properties up to room temperature. For example, vanadyl phthalocyanine (VOPc) diluted in a diamagnetic titanyl matrix exhibits room temperature coherence with a \\(T_{m}\\) of \\(\\sim\\)1 \\(\\mu\\)s at 300 K, even in the presence of a nuclear spin containing environment.[37] Spin echoes have also been observed up to room temperature in the benzene-1,2-dithiolate (bdt) ligated (Ph\\({}_{4}\\)P)\\({}_{2}\\)[Cu(C\\({}_{6}\\)H\\({}_{4}\\)S\\({}_{2}\\))\\({}_{2}\\)][33] (Cu(bdt)\\({}_{2}\\)) and the maleonitriledithiolate (mnt) ligated (Ph\\({}_{4}\\)P)\\({}_{2}\\)[Cu(mnt)\\({}_{2}\\)][50] (Cu(mnt)\\({}_{2}\\)) complexes diluted in diamagnetic Ni lattices. At lower temperatures (\\(\\sim\\)\\(<\\) 80 K), relaxation is dominated by the direct, Raman, and Orbach mechanisms, while a mechanism involving spin-phonon coupling and the modulation of the energy gap between the M\\({}_{s}=\\pm\\)\\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) sublevels dominates at higher temperatures.[51, 52] Thus, in order to achieve room temperature coherent materials, spin-phonon coupling and its contribution to \\(T_{I}\\) must be better understood. Doing so will allow for direct manipulation of geometric and electronic structure to overcome this barrier. Furthermore, while achieving room temperature coherence is of great technological interest for quantum information processing, these room temperature coherent materials will also provide exciting opportunities for the fundamental studies of spin-phonon coupling and will complement studies of single molecule magnets and photoactive transition metal complexes. Many of the highest performing S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) qubit candidates feature similar structural motifs: 1) a four coordinate square planar Cu(II), or 2) a four coordinate vanadyl moiety featuring a triple bond between the V(IV) and oxo ligand. Comparisons between 1) and 2) and six coordinate, pseudo \\(O_{h}\\) V(IV) complexes have also been made to highlight structural and electronic contributions to \\(T_{I}\\).[13, 33, 53] As shown below, multiple contributions need to be accounted for in order to make direct comparisons between S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) molecular qubits and thus to understand the origins of their coherence times. Given coherent superposition states are generated within the \\(\\mathrm{M_{S}=\\pm\\,\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}}\\) sublevels of a metal complex, coherence properties are expected to be influenced by the same contributions governing g-values. Ligand field theory (LFT) has provided expressions for understanding geometric and electronic structure contributions to the g-values of Cu(II) complexes [54]. Here this model is extended more generally to a dynamic regime, which allows for the direct understanding of spin-phonon coupling contributions to the g-values of \\(\\mathrm{S=\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}}\\) transition metal complexes. Using the ORCA program [55, 56], the LFT expressions are further supported by a range of spectroscopically calibrated density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations on the well-studied \\(D_{4h}\\) and \\(D_{2d}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)] [2- and \\(C_{4v}\\) [VOCI\\({}_{4}\\)] [57, 58]. The correlations between experiment and LFT, DFT, and TDDFT calculations have elucidated the key factors that contribute to the nature of spin-phonon coupling terms in \\(\\mathrm{S=\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}}\\) transition metal complexes, thus providing a detailed orbital and bonding picture for the first time. The model presented here indicates spin-phonon coupling terms are governed by the magnitude of the metal-based spin-orbit coupling (SOC) constant, excited state mixing of orbital angular momentum into the ground state, and dynamic relativistic nephelaavetic contributions. The latter contribution is directly related to the covalencies of ligand-metal bonds and can modify the metal-based SOC constant from that of the free ion in a dynamic manner. Also, correlations between dynamic ground state orbital angular momentum and excited state coupling terms and their relations to spin-phonon coupling terms are drawn for the first time. Specific group theoretical correlations between high and lower symmetry point groups further provide a means to evaluate spin-phonon coupling terms across transition metal complexes and molecular qubits featuring different ligand sets, geometries, and coordination numbers. The model is in excellent agreement with a wide range of experimental quantum coherence properties of Cu(II)- and V(IV)-based molecular qubits and therefore provides a means to rapidly evaluate spin-phonon coupling terms in any \\(\\mathrm{S=\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}}\\) transition metal complex, including new qubit candidates. ## 2 Results. ### Dynamic Ligand Field Theory of Cu(II) g-values. \\(D_{4h}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)] [2- has a \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{1g}\\) (x\\({}^{2}\\)-y\\({}^{2}\\)) ground state (Figure 1). In the absence of SOC, the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{1g}\\) ground state contains no orbital angular momentum and thus would exhibit a g-value of 2.0023 (e.g., g\\({}_{e}\\) of the free electron) in the presence of a magnetic field. However, SOC provides a means for excited states to mix into the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{1g}\\) ground state and thus introduce orbital angular momentum. This is shown in Figure 1 for \\(D_{4h}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\). Including SOC, the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{1g}\\) ground state (\\(\\Gamma_{7}\\)) can mix with both the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{2g}\\) (\\(\\Gamma_{7}\\)) and \\({}^{2}\\)E\\({}_{g}\\) (\\(\\Gamma_{6}+\\Gamma_{7}\\)) excited states (Figure 1). From first order perturbation theory, the ground state reflecting the contributions of excited state SOC is [54]: An applied magnetic field will project out different components of \\(\\mathbf{L}\\) (e.g., \\(\\mathbf{L_{x,y,z}}\\) ). Consequently, the magnitude of orbital angular momentum mixing into the ground state is anisotropic. The resulting perturbed ground state wavefunction can be mod ligand-metal interactions. For H \\(\\parallel\\) z and taking the covalency of the b\\({}_{1g}\\) and b\\({}_{2g}\\) orbitals into account, the expression for g\\({}_{\\parallel}\\) (g\\({}_{z}\\)) becomes:[54] In equation 5, \\(\\left(\\frac{\\partial g_{z}}{\\partial Q_{i}}\\right)\\) and \\(\\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2}g_{z}}{\\partial Q_{i}^{2}}\\right)\\) are the equilibrium values of \\(\\frac{\\partial g_{z}}{\\partial Q_{i}}\\) and \\(\\frac{\\partial^{2}g_{z}}{\\partial Q_{i}^{2}}\\) when \\(Q_{i}=0\\), respectively, \\(v_{i}\\)are the harmonic frequencies, and \\(m_{i}\\) are the reduced masses. To simplify the treatment of g\\({}_{z}\\), which depends on the position along a vibrational coordinate \\(Q_{i}\\), we separate the normal modes into two types under the harmonic approximation: even modes, where \\(g_{z}(Q_{even})=g_{z}(-Q_{even})\\) and odd modes, where \\(g_{z}(Q_{odd})=-g_{z}(Q_{odd})\\). For the former, at the equilibrium geometry, \\(\\frac{\\partial g_{z}}{\\partial Q_{even}}=0\\) and \\(\\frac{\\partial^{2}g_{z}}{\\partial Q_{even}^{2}}\\neq 0\\). For the latter, \\(\\frac{\\partial g_{z}}{\\partial Q_{odd}}\\neq 0\\) and \\(\\frac{\\partial^{2}g_{z}}{\\partial Q_{odd}^{2}}=0\\). Under the harmonic approximation, the first term in the expansion (equation 5) is non-zero for odd modes, while the second term is non-zero for even modes. It is clear from this expression that odd modes have a larger impact on the variance of g\\({}_{z}\\) and consequently the coherence lifetime. \\(\\partial g_{z}\\big{/}\\partial Q_{i}\\) and \\(\\partial^{2}g_{z}\\big{/}\\partial Q_{i}^{2}\\) at the equilibrium geometries can be directly related to ligand field parameters in equations 2 and 3. Taking the partial derivative of equation 2 with respect to a vibration coordinate \\(Q_{i}\\) gives: where \\(\\eta=\\ \\alpha_{1}^{2}\\beta_{1}^{2}\\) and provides adjustments due to covalency. We make the assumption that \\(\\alpha_{1}^{2}\\) and \\(\\beta_{1}^{2}\\) change linearly with one another at minimal displacements about the equilibrium position and can therefore be represented by a single \"covalency\" parameter, \\(\\eta\\). In the regime where \\(\\eta\\left(\\partial E_{B_{2g}}\\Big{/}\\partial Q_{i}\\right)\\gg E_{B_{2g}}\\left( \\partial\\eta\\big{/}\\partial Q_{i}\\right)\\), \\(\\partial g_{z}\\big{/}\\partial Q_{i}\\) will have an inverse square dependence on \\(E_{B_{2g}}\\). Conversely, when \\(\\eta\\left(\\partial E_{B_{2g}}\\Big{/}\\partial Q_{i}\\right)\\ll E_{B_{2g}}\\left( \\partial\\eta/\\partial Q_{i}\\right)\\), \\(\\partial g_{z}/\\partial Q_{i}\\) will have an inverse dependence on \\(E_{B_{2g}}\\) and a linear dependence with covalency, \\(\\eta\\). In both cases, the role of the transition energy is clear: The higher the energy separation from the ground state, the lower the \\(\\partial g_{z}/\\partial Q_{i}\\) term by at least an inverse dependence. However, as shown below, the complexes considered here are largely in the regime corresponding to an inverse square dependence on \\(E_{B_{2g}}\\). For even modes under the harmonic approximation and at the equilibrium geometry, \\(\\partial E_{B_{2g}}/\\partial Q_{i}=\\partial\\eta/\\partial Q_{i}=0\\). To describe the variance in the energy gap for even modes, a second partial derivative of g\\({}_{x}\\) with respect to the vibrational coordinate is needed. The spin-phonon coupling terms \\(\\partial g_{z}/\\partial Q_{i}\\)and \\(\\partial^{2}g_{z}/\\partial Q_{i}^{2}\\) for odd and even modes, respectively, are therefore related to spectroscopic observables and quantities that are easily calculable. It should be noted that the treatment above has been generated with respect to g\\({}_{x}\\) of \\(D_{th}\\) Cu(II), but can be done analogously for any S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) system. At the very least, the equations above can be used as screening tools to estimate relative coherence lifetimes of molecular qubits by estimating parameters such as the relevant d-d transition energies and covalencies of the ligand-metal bonds, which can be obtained from quantum chemical calculations. The spin-phonon coupling terms in equations 6 and 7 have been computed for a large scope of S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) transition metal qubits reported in the literature to establish ligand field principles for manipulating coherence lifetimes. Below, we utilize \\(D_{4h}\\) and \\(D_{2d}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- as structural models to quantitatively evaluate this LFT model using DFT and TDDFT calculations and to define the nature of spin-phonon coupling terms in Cu(II) complexes. This analysis is then translated to \\(C_{\\mathcal{W}}\\)",
            "output_text": "## Introduction\n\nThe interaction between electron spin and phonons, or vibrations, in transition metal complexes is pivotal to their dynamic properties, influencing phenomena such as spin-state transitions, ultrafast spin dynamics, and the magnetization behavior in single molecule magnets and potential applications in quantum information processing. Spin-phonon coupling plays a crucial role in the photophysical and photochemical characteristics of these complexes, as well as in solid-state phenomena like colossal magnetoresistance and high-temperature superconductivity. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of this coupling is essential for optimizing coherence in quantum bits (qubits) based on $\\mathrm{S = \\frac{1}{2}}$ transition metals.\n\nRecent advancements in using $\\mathrm{S = \\frac{1}{2}}$ complexes as qubits exploit the spin-split sublevels for quantum computation, with coherence typically initialized and manipulated through microwave pulses. However, maintaining coherence for practical applications requires long lifetimes, which are limited by spin-lattice relaxation ($T_{I}$) processes. These processes are influenced by the complex's geometric and electronic structure, particularly ligand field effects. Experimental efforts have focused on reducing nuclear spin contamination to enhance coherence, but room temperature coherent materials remain scarce.\n\nTo address this challenge, a comprehensive ligand field theory (LFT) model is developed in this study, which generalizes the understanding of spin-phonon coupling in $\\mathrm{S = \\frac{1}{2}}$ complexes. The model accounts for three key factors: the strength of metal-based spin-orbit coupling, variations in ligand field excited state energies, and dynamic relativistic nephelauxetic contributions due to bond covalency. By comparing DFT and TDDFT calculations with experimental data for $\\mathrm{D_{\\mu\\mu}}$ and $\\mathrm{C_{\\nu\\nu}}$ complexes, the model demonstrates the correspondence between calculated spin-phonon coupling terms and observed quantum coherence properties in various $\\mathrm{Cu^{II}}$ and $\\mathrm{V^{IV}}$ complexes with different ligands, geometries, and coordination numbers.\n\nThis work not only provides a theoretical framework to evaluate and improve coherence in molecular qubits but also offers insights into designing room temperature coherent materials for quantum information processing. The model's success in accurately predicting coherence properties across a range of complexes underscores its potential for rapid assessment and guiding the discovery of new qubit candidates.\n\n### Dynamic Ligand Field Theory for Cu(II) g-Values\n\nThe starting point for understanding the $\\mathrm{Cu^{II}}$ complexes is the $\\mathrm{D_{4h}}$ [CuCl$_{4}$] $\\mathrm{^2B_{1g}}$ ground state without spin-orbit coupling. In this case, the g-factor would be 2.0023, corresponding to the free electron value. However, SOC introduces mixing of excited state orbital angular momentum into the ground state, modifying the g-factor. The model derived from LFT, incorporating first-order perturbation theory, shows that the g-factor anisotropy arises due to the projection of orbital angular momentum onto different axes in the presence of an external magnetic field. The magnitude of this effect depends on the vibrational modes and their associated frequencies.\n\nFor the $\\mathrm{D_{4h}}$ [CuCl$_{4}$] $\\mathrm{^2B_{1g}}$ complex, the perturbed ground state wavefunction, which includes contributions from excited state SOC, is given by:\n\n\\[ | \\psi_{g} \\rangle = c_1 | \\psi_{\\mathrm{^2B_{1g}}} \\rangle + c_2 | \\psi_{\\mathrm{^2B_{2g}}} \\rangle + c_3 | \\psi_{\\mathrm{^2E_{g}}} \\rangle \\]\n\nwhere $c_i$ are coefficients determined by the excited state mixing. When a magnetic field is applied, the components with different orbital angular momentum contribute differently to the total g-factor. The anisotropy in $g_{\\parallel}$ (along the z-axis) can be expressed as:\n\n\\[ g_{\\parallel} = g_e + \\Delta g \\]\n\nHere, $g_e$ is the free electron value, and $\\Delta g$ is the correction due to SOC and excited state mixing. The dependence of $\\Delta g$ on the vibrational coordinates is captured by the derivatives $\\partial g_z / \\partial Q_i$ and $\\partial^2 g_z / \\partial Q_i^2$, which can be related to ligand field parameters.\n\nThe model highlights that odd vibrational modes have a greater impact on the variance of $g_{z}$, thus affecting coherence lifetimes. The equilibrium values and derivatives for $g_z$ can be obtained from equations involving the ligand field parameters. For even modes, the influence on the energy gap is described by a second derivative of $g_x$ with respect to the vibrational coordinate.\n\nBy applying this LFT model to $\\mathrm{D_{4h}}$ and $\\mathrm{D_{2d}}$ [CuCl$_{4}$] complexes, the model is validated through DFT and TDDFT calculations, providing a quantitative evaluation of spin-phonon coupling terms and revealing the underlying principles for manipulating coherence in $\\mathrm{Cu^{II}}$ complexes. The successful application of this theory to these complexes sets the stage for extending the model to other $\\mathrm{S = \\frac{1}{2}}$ transition metal systems and assessing their coherence properties."

            "input_text": "[VOC\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- and finally to a variety of Cu(II)- and V(IV)-based molecular qubits reported in the literature. ### Spin-Phonon Coupling Terms in [CuCl4]\\({}^{2}\\): Depending on the counterion, [CuCl4]\\({}^{2}\\)- can exist in a series of distorted \\(T_{d}\\) geometries along the \\(D_{4h}\\) to \\(D_{2d}\\) coordinate. This distortion coordinate is governed by the Cl-Cu-Cl angle, \\(\\alpha\\). A broad range of spectroscopic methods have defined the electronic structures of \\(D_{4h}\\) and \\(D_{2d}\\) [CuCl4]\\({}^{2}\\). By correlating calculations to these data, Solomon et al.[57, 58] have developed a spectroscopically calibrated DFT-based methodology that accurately reproduces the experimental data and thus the bonding (e.g., covalency). Key to this description is the incorporation of 38% Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange into the DFT exchange correlation functional.[57, 58] This methodology has been used for calculations presented in this section. As discussed in the Methods (see Supporting Information), a calibrated amount of HF exchange is determined independently for each case considered in subsequent sections. The DFT calculated g-values and excited state energies for an idealized \\(D_{4h}\\) [CuCl4]\\({}^{2}\\)-structure are compared to experiment in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Note for both \\(D_{2d}\\) and \\(D_{4h}\\) [CuCl4]\\({}^{2}\\)-, idealized structures give nearly identical results to those resulting from crystal structures[61]; for a more direct comparison to group theory, only results from the idealized structures are presented here (see Methods in Supporting Information and Table S1a/b for bond distances and angles). Experimentally, the \\(D_{4h}\\) g\\({}_{x}\\)- and g\\({}_{x,y}\\)-values are 2.221 and 2.040, respectively.[62, 63] The calculated values for an idealized geometry based on the X-ray crystallographic structure are 2.204 and 2.056, respectively, in agreement with experiment. The HF dependence of the g\\({}_{x}\\)-value for this structure is given in Figure S1. A vibrational frequency analysis was carried out using the idealized \\(D_{4h}\\) [CuCl4]\\({}^{2}\\)- structure. The energies, symmetry labels, and scaled vector displacements for all nine normal modes of vibration are given in Table S2a. Using these vibrations, full spin-phonon analyses using the calculated g-values were carried out as described in the Methods section. The coupling terms for g\\({}_{x}\\) (g\\({}_{\\parallel}\\)) are first described, followed by analyses of g\\({}_{x,y}\\) (g\\({}_{\\perp}\\)). Briefly, the coupling term for a given g-value and vibrational mode is determined by calculating the g-value along positive and negative distortions about a given normal mode, and the magnitude of the coupling term can be qualitatively estimated by the magnitude of the slope (for odd modes) or curvature (for even modes). The spin-phonon coupling term calculations for the g\\({}_{x}\\)-value of idealized \\(D_{4h}\\) [CuCl4]\\({}^{2}\\)- are given in Figure 2A, and their fits are given in Table S3a. Note these fits are reported for the scaled vibrationaldisplacements and are converted for comparison purposes when possible to A-1 or \\({}^{\\circ-1}\\). The largest coupling term is observed for the totally symmetric \\(a_{lg}\\) breathing mode (mode 7, 296 cm-1), which shows a strong linear dependence between the g\\({}_{x}\\)-value and the vibrational coordinate. Note the calculated frequency for the \\(a_{lg}\\) mode is in fairly good agreement with experimental vibrational energy (276 cm-1).[58] For the \\(a_{lg}\\) mode, a linear fit along the vibrational mode, \\(Q_{i}\\), provides a slope of -0.241 g\\({}_{x}\\)/\\(Q_{i}\\) (0.482 g\\({}_{x}\\)/A). Interestingly, the spin-phonon coupling terms for the totally symmetric stretch exhibit insightful trends when compared to \\(D_{2d}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]2- and \\(C_{4v}\\) [VOCl\\({}_{4}\\)]2-, while also correlating with experimental coherence properties as discussed below. Figure 2: Evolution of the g\\({}_{x}\\)-values along each normal mode of vibration for idealized structures of (a) \\(D_{4h}\\) and (b) \\(D_{2d}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]2-. Insets provide zoomed in views for positive distortion and pictorial representations of the respective molecules. Of the other vibrational modes, 1 (_b2u_, -86 cm-1), 2 (_a2u_, 140 cm-1), 3/4 (_e\\({}_{u}\\) (1a, 1b)_, 172 cm-1), and 8/9 (_e\\({}_{u}\\) (2a, 2b)_, 342 cm-1) are even modes with quadratic coupling terms. The _a2u_ and _e\\({}_{u}\\) (2a, 2b)_ modes exhibit the largest coupling terms (0.119 and -0.272 g/_Q\\({}_{i}\\)_, respectively) and involve motion of the metal out-of-plane and in-plane, respectively (Table S2a). For the _a2u_ mode, the slope can be better quantified by using the amount of metal displacement and gives 0.216 g/A. The coefficients for the _b2u_ and _e\\({}_{u}\\) (1a, 1b)_ modes are -0.063 and -0.056 g/_Q\\({}_{i}\\)_, respectively. While the quadratic spin-phonon coupling terms of the _e\\({}_{u}\\) (2a, 2b)_ modes are the largest, they also have the highest calculated frequencies (342 cm-1) and are therefore not considered in detail here, as these modes will not be as thermally populated past their zero-point energies at practical temperatures. Finally, modes 5 (_b2g_, 183 cm-1) and 6 (_b1g_, 198 cm-1) exhibit negligible spin-phonon coupling terms with the g\\({}_{x}\\)-value (Table S3a). Note, however, the corresponding coupling terms are substantially smaller when the magnetic field is oriented along _L\\({}_{\\mathbf{x}}\\)_ or _L\\({}_{\\mathbf{y}}\\)_ (i.e., for g\\({}_{x,y}\\)-values). Also, the spin-phonon coupling term for the _b2u_ mode is increased substantially in the _D2d_ structure. These observations are discussed further below. Given the ligand field origin of the SOC induced mixing of orbital angular momentum into the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{1\\mathrm{g}}\\) ground state (Figure 1), an analysis of the excited state energies was also carried out. Comparisons between experimental and calculated ligand field transitions are given in Table 2. Experimentally, the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{2\\mathrm{g}}\\), \\({}^{2}\\)E\\({}_{\\mathrm{g}}\\), and \\({}^{2}\\)A\\({}_{1\\mathrm{g}}\\) ligand field transitions of \\(D_{4h}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2\\cdot}\\) are observed at 12000, 13500, and 16500 cm\\({}^{\\cdot}\\)1, respectively.[64] From equation 2, the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{2\\mathrm{g}}\\) excited state can introduce ground state orbital angular momentum through SOC, and the g\\({}_{x}\\)-value is inversely dependent on the ligand field energy. A TDDFT calculation gives an energy of 14470 cm-1, in fairly good agreement. The vibrational analysis of the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{2\\mathrm{g}}\\) ligand field excited state is given in Figure 3a, and their fits are given in Table S3a. Note the calculation of the ligand field energy along a given vibrational mode provides the excited state coupling term, which takes into account the displacement between the ground and excited state potential energy surfaces (Figure 4a). This displacement of the excited surface relative to the ground state results in a distorting force along a normal mode, \\(Q_{i}\\), in the excited state. This distorting force can be estimated by evaluating the effect of electron-nuclear coupling on the total energy of the excited state, E\\({}_{\\mathrm{ES}}\\):[54] For non-zero values of this integral, the excited state will distort along \\(Q_{i}\\) by a value \\(\\Delta Q_{i}\\); the excited state coupling term is determined by calculating the energy change in the electronic transition to \\(\\psi_{\\rm e}\\) with a change along the coordinate \\(Q_{i}\\). This is shown qualitatively for \\(D_{4h}\\) and \\(D_{2d}\\) structures in Figure 4a. The partial derivative (\\(\\partial E/\\partial Q_{i}\\)) reflects the relative curvature of the excited state potential energy surface near the ground state equilibrium geometry (i.e., in the vicinity of the Franck-Condon region). The excited state coupling term therefore provides a means to quantify the change in excited state orbital angular momentum that can SOC into the ground state along a given vibrational coordinate. **Figure 3**. Evolution of the d(x\\({}^{2}\\)-y\\({}^{2}\\)) \\(\\rightarrow\\) d(xy) transition energies for (a) \\(D_{4h}\\) and (b) \\(D_{2d}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\). As with the g\\({}_{x}\\)-value analysis, the totally symmetric \\(a_{lg}\\) mode exhibits the largest coupling term for the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{1\\rm g}\\) excited state (Figure 3a). The slope of the \\(a_{lg}\\) mode is 12405 cm-1/\\(Q_{i}\\), which gives -24940 cm-1/A. That is, the energy of the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{1\\rm g}\\) state decreases as the ligand-metal bonds are elongated and vice versa. The quadradic terms for the \\(a_{2u}\\) mode are -6700 cm-1/\\(Q_{i}\\) and -12230 cm-1/A. Note the slopes and curvatures of the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{2\\rm g}\\) energy are inverted relative to those for the g\\({}_{x}\\)-value slope (Figure 2a). This behavior is consistent with equation 2 and the inverse energy dependence on SOC. The other modes discussed above that exhibit spin-phonon coupling terms with the g\\({}_{x}\\)-value also exhibit inverted behavior. For example, the \\(a_{2u}\\) and \\(b_{2u}\\) modes exhibit positive quadratic behaviors in Figure 2a and negative ones in Figure 3a. Note the \\(b_{lg}\\) mode does not exhibit a substantial coupling term for the g\\({}_{x}\\)-value but does with the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{2\\rm g}\\) energy. This is due to the nature of the \\(b_{lg}\\) vibrational distortion (see Table S2a), which lowers the symmetry from \\(D_{4h}\\) to \\(D_{2h}\\) by making two of the Cu(II)-Cl bonds, and thus the x- and y-axes, inequivalent. This turns on a small mixing between a forbidden (in \\(D_{4h}\\)) \\({}^{2}\\)A\\({}_{2\\rm g}\\) charge transfer state and the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{2\\rm g}\\) ligand field state. Both of these states transform as \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{1\\rm g}\\) upon lowering symmetry to \\(D_{2h}\\). The energy of the forbidden \\({}^{2}\\)A\\({}_{2\\rm g}\\) state exhibits a strong dependence on the \\(b_{lg}\\) mode distortion. Thus, we ascribe the energy shift of the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{2g}\\) state observed in Figure 3a to this mixing. Also, other than \\(e_{u}\\)_(2a, 2b)_ modes, no other modes exhibit this distortion induced mixing, and they maintain their original ligand field compositions observed for the \\(D_{4h}\\) structure. Thus, the excited state coupling term (equation 8) for the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{1g}\\)\\(\\rightarrow\\)\\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{2g}\\) excitation provides a means to evaluate the vibrationally induced change in ground state orbital angular momentum and its effect on the g\\({}_{x}\\)-value. Figure 4: Qualitative potential energy surfaces of [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\). (a) Excited state linear coupling terms for the totally symmetric Cu–Cl stretch, and (b) change in the excited state linear coupling term upon distorting from \\(D_{4h}\\) to \\(D_{2d}\\). To simplify (a), the ground state potential energy surfaces of \\(D_{4h}\\) and \\(D_{2d}\\) are overlaid even though their Cu–Cl bonds do not have the same equilibrium distance. In addition to excited state SOC, equation 2 indicates covalency contributions are important determinants of molecular g-values. Experimentally, the Cu(d) character for \\(D_{4h}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- is 0.62 \\(\\pm\\) 0.2 [57, 58]. The \\(\\beta\\)-LUMO of the model considered here is given in Figure 1 and reflects a total Cu(d) character and spin density of 65 % and 0.668 from Loewdin population analysis and spin density, respectively. Importantly, as shown below, the measure of covalency at the equilibrium geometry, by proxy of the spin density, is a key determinant to understanding its role in spin-phonon coupling terms. Thus, the 38 % HF method applied to a complex with known Cu(d) character provides an excellent starting point. Fits for the spin-phonon coupling term analyses using Cu spin densities are given in Table S3e. The fits for the \\(a_{lg}\\) mode give values of -0.157 SD/\\(Q_{i}\\) and 0.221 SD/A. As observed above for g\\({}_{x}\\)-values and the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{2g}\\) energies, the largest coupling term for Cu spin density is observed for the totally symmetric \\(a_{lg}\\) mode. For this mode, the change in covalency along the \\(a_{lg}\\) coordinate contributes in the same direction/sign to the change in g\\({}_{x}\\)-value as the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{2g}\\) ligand field energy. This is also the case for the \\(b_{2u}\\) mode. The concerted contribution from ligand field energies and covalency is not observed for all modes, however. From example, the Cu spin density contribution for the \\(a_{2u}\\) mode opposes the contribution to the g\\({}_{x}\\)-value from the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{1g}\\) excited state and illustrates an important interplay between excited state SOC and covalency to the resulting spin-phonon coupling term for the g\\({}_{x}\\)-value. The individual contributions to the g\\({}_{x}\\)-value from the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{1g}\\) energy and Cu spin density can be estimated using equation 2 in combination with the DFT and TDDFT calculations. For example, for \\(D_{4h}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)-, using the calculated Cu spin density of 0.668 and the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{1g}\\) energy of 14475 cm\\({}^{-1}\\), equation 2 predicts a g\\({}_{x}\\)-value of 2.205. This is similar to the DFT calculated g\\({}_{x}\\)-value (2.204). For each mode, the relative change in spin density and/or \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{1g}\\) energy can be used to estimate a change in g\\({}_{x}\\)-value. The g\\({}_{x}\\)-value estimated from equation 2 can thus be compared directly to the DFT calculated change in g\\({}_{x}\\)-value along each vibrational coordinate. These plots for all normal modes and each g-value are given in Figures S3-S5; the results for the \\(b_{2u}\\), \\(a_{2u}\\), and \\(a_{lg}\\) modes are given in Figures 5 (a-c), respectively. From these comparisons for the \\(b_{2u}\\) mode (Figure 5a), the Cu spin density and \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{2g}\\) energy both contribute appreciably to the change in g\\({}_{z}\\)-value. Furthermore, for the \\(a_{2u}\\) mode (Figure 5b), the change in g\\({}_{x}\\)-value is largely due to the change in the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{2g}\\) energy; as mentioned above, a small component from the Cu spin density component actually opposes the change in g\\({}_{x}\\)-value determined by the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{2g}\\) energy alone. Lastly, for the \\(a_{lg}\\) mode, the change in the g\\({}_{z}\\)-value is largely due to the change in \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{2g}\\) energy, but the spin density component contributes to a small extent. Thus, this analysis (Figure 5 and Figures S3-S5) provides a means to qualitatively decompose the spin-phonon coupling term contributions from ground state covalency and orbital angular momentum from excited state SOC. The spin-phonon coupling terms for the g\\({}_{x,y}\\)-values for the \\(D_{4h}\\) structure are given in Figure S9, with the corresponding fits given in Table S3b and S3c.The coupling terms for the g\\({}_{x}\\)- and g\\({}_{y}\\)-values are very similar except for the inversion of the \\(e_{u}\\) modes (e.g., the \\(1a/2a\\) components switch with",

Comprehensive spectroscopic investigations have characterized the electronic structures of these isomers, particularly the \\(D_{4h}\\) and \\(D_{2d}\\) varieties. Solomon et al. developed a computational approach integrating 38% Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange into density functional theory (DFT) exchange-correlation functional to accurately reproduce experimental data, including bondings and electronic properties. This method, explained in the supplementary information, is applied to calculate and compare DFT and experimental g-factors and excited state energies.\n\nFor the idealized \\(D_{4h}\\) [CuCl4]^2-, the calculated g-values match experimental measurements, with a slight difference observed for the X-ray crystallographic structure, which is 2.204 for g_x and 2.056 for g_xy. The influence of the Hartree-Fock exchange on the g_x value is illustrated in Figure S1. Vibrational frequency analysis was performed using the idealized structure, revealing nine normal modes of vibration with their corresponding symmetries and vibrational energies in Table S2a. Spin-phonon coupling terms were calculated for g_x, considering both parallel (g_parallel) and perpendicular (g_perp) components.\n\nThe largest coupling term, associated with the totally symmetric \\(a_{lg}\\) mode, shows a linear dependence with the g_x value, indicating a strong interaction between the spin and phonons. The spin-phonon coupling for g_x in \\(D_{4h}\\) [CuCl4]^2- is presented in Figure 2A, with fitting parameters provided in Table S3a. The totally symmetric stretch, represented by the \\(a_{2u}\\) mode, exhibits quadratic coupling terms, reflecting out-of-plane and in-plane motion of the metal ions. Other modes like the \\(b2u\\) and \\(e_u\\) modes display quadratic or linear coupling, with distinct trends compared to \\(D_{2d}\\) and \\(C_{4v}\\) complexes.\n\nExcited state energies, particularly the \\({}^{2}\\)B_{2g}, \\({}^{2}\\)E_g, and \\({}^{2}\\)A_{1g} transitions, are analyzed to understand the effect of ligand field transitions on the g_x value. The calculated \\({}^{2}\\)B_{2g} energy of 14470 cm^-1 agrees well with experimental data. The vibrational analysis of the \\({}^{2}\\)B_{2g} state reveals inverted behaviors in the coupling terms compared to g_x, as expected from the inverse dependence on spin-orbit coupling.\n\nCovalency, determined by the Cu(d) character, plays a significant role in the spin-phonon coupling. A 38% HF exchange in the DFT calculations accounts for the copper's d-character, with the largest coupling again observed for the \\(a_{lg}\\) mode. The change in spin density contributes to the g_x value in a similar direction as the \\({}^{2}\\)B_{2g} energy. The interplay between covalency and excited state SOC is evident in the \\(a_{2u}\\) mode, where the Cu spin density opposes the change in g_x driven by the \\({}^{2}\\)B_{2g} energy.\n\nIn summary, the spin-phonon coupling terms in [CuCl4]^2- are studied through calculations and analysis of g-factors and vibrational modes. The complex geometry and the interplay between electronic structure, covalency, and spin-orbit coupling lead to a nuanced understanding of the spin-phonon interactions in these systems. The findings provide valuable insights into the design and manipulation of molecular qubits based on Cu(II) and V(IV) ions."

            "input_text": "the \\(2a/2b\\) components). As with the g\\({}_{z}\\)-value, the largest coupling term for the g\\({}_{x,y}\\)-values is observed for the \\(a_{lg}\\) mode (-0.072 g\\({}_{z}/Q_{i}\\)). However, the coupling term for the g\\({}_{x,y}\\)-values is significantly less than that observed for g\\({}_{z}\\)-values (-0.241 g\\({}_{x}/Q_{i}\\)) by a factor of \\(\\sim\\)3.3. This difference reflects the ratio of the prefactors given in equations 2 and 3, as well as contributions from anisotropic covalency. The other modes show a similar behavior between g\\({}_{x}\\)- and g\\({}_{z}\\)-values and therefore are not discussed here. However, while the \\(b_{lg}\\) mode exhibited a negligible spin-phonon coupling term for the g\\({}_{x}\\)-value (Figure 2a), it exhibits a larger coupling term for the g\\({}_{x,y}\\)-values (Figures S8a/b). Thus, the main differences between the g\\({}_{x}\\) and g\\({}_{x,y}\\) regions is the magnitude and anisotropy of the spin-phonon coupling terms, with different vibrational modes (e.g., \\(b_{lg}\\) mode) being selectively activated in the g\\({}_{\\perp}\\) region. Figure 5: Independent contributions from d-d transition energy and ligand–metal covalency to the change in g\\({}_{z}\\) for \\(D_{4h}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- Comparisons are made between the \\(\\Delta\\)g\\({}_{x}\\) as calculated from the LFT expression and as computed using ORCA for modes (a) \\(b_{2u}\\), (b) \\(a_{2u}\\), and (c) \\(a_{lg}\\). For these plots, the square of the spin density on Cu was used as a proxy for the covalency. Vector displacements are provided for each vibrational distortion. The corresponding spin-phonon coupling terms of the two components of the \\({}^{2}\\)E\\({}_{\\rm g}\\) excited state are given in Figure S10. The correlation between the g\\({}_{x,y}\\)-values and the excited state SOC is similar to that laid out for the g\\({}_{x}\\)-value and is therefore not addressed further here. In summary for \\(D_{th}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)-, up to the totally symmetric stretch, the vibrational modes that exhibit the largest spin-phonon coupling terms are the \\(a_{2u}\\) and \\(a_{lg}\\) modes, with the \\(b_{2u}\\) and \\(e_{u}\\) _(1a, 1b)_ modes having smaller coupling terms. Excited state SOC and covalent contributions are both important quantifiers and determinants of spin-phonon coupling terms, and they can either work cooperatively or oppose one another (Figure 5). Lastly, the spin-phonon coupling terms are anisotropic between the g\\({}_{\\parallel}\\) and g\\({}_{\\perp}\\) regions, with a general decrease in coupling terms in the g\\({}_{\\perp}\\) region and an activation of different vibrational modes. This anisotropy may be an interesting way to experimentally probe and explore spin-phonon coupling terms in transition metal complexes and qubits. #### 2.2.2 \\(D_{2d}\\) and Comparisons to \\(D_{4h}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)-. Experimentally, going from \\(D_{th}\\) to \\(D_{2d}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)-, the g-values shift from 2.221 and 2.040 to 2.435 and 2.079, respectively (Table 1). The experimental increase in g-values is reproduced by the DFT calculated g-values (2.309 and 2.095, respectively). In addition, the ligand field strength decreases significantly upon distorting to \\(D_{2d}\\), which results in a decrease in the ligand field transition energies to 5500, 8000, and 9400 cm-1. The transition at 8000 cm-1 is the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{2}\\)\\(\\rightarrow\\)\\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{1}\\) transition, which is predicted at 10440 cm-1 using TDDFT. Note in going from \\(D_{th}\\) to \\(D_{2d}\\) group theory requires the ground state transform as \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{2}\\) (Figure 1).[64] While this formally leads to a switch of the ground state from x\\({}^{2}\\)-y\\({}^{2}\\) to xy, the overall orientation of the orbital with respect to the ligand-metal bonds does not change upon lowering symmetry from \\(D_{4h}\\) to \\(D_{2d}\\), and we therefore retain the x\\({}^{2}\\)-y\\({}^{2}\\) labeling as done previously.[54] Translating to the \\(D_{2d}\\) structure decreases the overlap between the Cu d(x\\({}^{2}\\)-y\\({}^{2}\\)) orbital and the ligand p orbitals, which results in a decrease in the covalency of the Cu-Cl bonds and thus a larger Cu spin density. As done above for \\(D_{th}\\), using the DFT calculated spin density, the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{1}\\) ligand field energy, and equation 2 predicts a g\\({}_{z}\\)-value of 2.361, which is in the range of that predicted from the DFT calculation (2.309). The spin-phonon analysis for the g\\({}_{z}\\)-value of \\(D_{2d}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- is given in Figure 2B (fits given in Table S4a). Note that group theory provides a means to directly correlate the vibrational modes between the \\(D_{4h}\\) and \\(D_{2d}\\) structures. These correlations are applied here and are reflected in the labels of the \\(D_{2d}\\) figures and tables throughout. As observed for the \\(D_{4h}\\) structure, the largest coupling term for the \\(D_{2d}\\) structure is observed for the totally symmetric breathing mode, \\(a_{1}\\)_(2)_ (mode 7, Table S3) (\\(a_{lg}\\) in \\(D_{4h}\\)). For the \\(a_{1}\\)_(2)_ mode, a linear fit along the vibrational mode, \\(Q_{i}\\), provides a slope of -0.306 g\\({}_{z}\\)/\\(Q_{i}\\) (0.612 g\\({}_{z}\\)/A). These slopes are larger than those observed for the \\(a_{lg}\\) mode in the \\(D_{4h}\\) structure (-0.241 g\\({}_{z}\\)/\\(Q_{i}\\) and 0.482 g\\({}_{z}\\)/A). Furthermore, while no other modes exhibited substantial linear coupling terms in the \\(D_{4h}\\) structure, from the spin-phonon analyses in Figure 2B, the \\(a_{1}\\)_(1)_ mode (mode 1 in both \\(D_{4h}\\) and \\(D_{2d}\\); \\(b_{2u}\\) in \\(D_{4h}\\)) becomes activated and linear in the \\(D_{2d}\\) structure. For the \\(a_{1}\\)_(1)_ mode, the linear fit along the vibrational mode, \\(Q_{i}\\), provides a slope of 0.140 g\\({}_{z}\\)/\\(Q_{i}\\). The activation of the \\(a_{1}\\)_(1)_ mode and the observation of linear coupling term behavior upon going to the \\(D_{2d}\\) structure is discussed below. The quadratic coefficient of the \\(b_{2}\\)_(1)_ mode of the \\(D_{2d}\\) structure (-0.068 g\\({}_{z}\\)/\\(Q_{i}\\)) is reduced relative to the \\(D_{4h}\\) structure (0.119 g\\({}_{z}\\)/\\(Q_{i}\\)) (\\(a_{2u}\\) in \\(D_{4h}\\)). Of the modes with frequencies less than the \\(a_{1}\\)_(2)_ totally symmetric stretch, the \\(b_{2}\\)_(2)_ mode has a quadratic coefficient of -0.295 g\\({}_{z}\\)/\\(Q_{i}\\), which is activated relative to the \\(D_{4h}\\) structure in which a very small coupling term was observed (\\(b_{lg}\\) in \\(D_{4h}\\)). The spin-phonon analysis for the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{1}\\) excited state of \\(D_{2d}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- is given in Figure 3B. Both \\(a_{1}\\)_(2)_ and \\(a_{1}\\)_(1)_ modes exhibit oppositely signed slopes between Figure 2B and 3B, indicating appreciable contributions to the spin-phonon coupling term from excited state SOC. For the \\(a_{1}\\)_(2)_ mode, the linear fit along the vibrational mode, \\(Q_{i}\\), provides a slope of 7885 cm\\({}^{\\text{-1}}\\)/\\(Q_{i}\\) (-15770 cm\\({}^{\\text{-1}}\\)/A). Interestingly, these slopes are smaller than those observed for the \\(a_{lg}\\) mode in the \\(D_{4h}\\) structure (12405 cm\\({}^{\\text{-1}}\\)/\\(Q_{i}\\) and -24940 cm\\({}^{\\text{-1}}\\)/A). The larger slope for the \\(D_{4h}\\) structure might suggest it would have a larger spin-phonon coupling term. However, equation 2 and its differentiated forms predict important behavior in this regard when comparing the \\(D_{4h}\\) and \\(D_{2d}\\) structures. This behavior is addressed below. The slope of the \\(a_{1}\\)_(1)_ mode for the \\(D_{2d}\\) structure is -3925 cm\\({}^{\\text{-1}}\\)/\\(Q_{i}\\), which is roughly half that observed for the \\(a_{1}\\)_(2)_ mode (7885 cm\\({}^{\\text{-1}}\\)/\\(Q_{i}\\)). The activation of this mode is a direct consequence of the symmetry about the Cu complex and its effect on the excited state coupling term (equation 8). This is shown pictorially in Figure 4b. For the \\(D_{4h}\\) structure, the \\(b_{2u}\\) mode is imaginary, representing a saddle point on the ground state potential energy surface. It has also been stressed that the \\(D_{4h}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- structure arises due to crystal packing forces, and the \\(D_{2d}\\) structure represents the energetic minimum on the ground state potential energy surface.[57] However, the symmetry of the complex has important consequence for the excited state coupling term and thus the spin-phonon coupling terms. In the \\(D_{4h}\\) structure, the excited state that can SOC with the ground state is at an energetic maximum along the \\(b_{2u}\\) (in \\(D_{4h}\\)) mode connecting the \\(D_{4h}\\) and \\(D_{2d}\\) structure. Upon distorting along this mode, both the ground and excited state energies are reduced. At the ground state minimum the excited state potential energy surface is shifted relative to the ground state surface. This offset gives rise to a non-zero excited state coupling term for the \\(D_{2d}\\) structure. As discussed above, a non-zero excited state coupling term provides a mechanism for the amount of orbital angular momentum mixed into the \\(D_{2d}\\) ground state to change along the vibrational mode. This mixing is prohibited in the \\(D_{4h}\\) ground state. In some ways, this qualitatively resembles atomic clock transitions that have also been utilized in the development of qubits.[65, 66, 67, 35, 68] The spin density as a function of the vibrational coordinate for the \\(D_{2d}\\) structure is given in Figure S2B. The slopes for the \\(a_{I}\\)_(2)_ mode are -0.157 SD/\\(Q_{i}\\) and 0.315 SD/A. These are larger than the values for the \\(a_{lg}\\) mode in the \\(D_{4h}\\) structure (-0.111 SD/\\(Q_{i}\\) and 0.221 SD/A). As done for the \\(D_{4h}\\) structure, the individual contributions to the g\\({}_{z}\\)-value from the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{1g}\\) energy and Cu spin density can be estimated using equation 2. These results are given in Figures S6-S8. The spin-phonon analyses were extended to the g\\({}_{x,y}\\)-values of \\(D_{2d}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)-. These results are given in Figure S11 and Tables S4b and S4c. The corresponding vibrational analyses are for the \\({}^{2}\\)E excited state of \\(D_{2d}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- are given in Figure S12 and Tables S4b and S4b. Similar to \\(D_{4h}\\), there are new modes that are activated for the g\\({}_{x,y}\\)-values. For the \\(D_{2d}\\) structure, these include the \\(b_{2}\\)_(1)_ and \\(b_{2}\\)_(2)_ modes. In summary, for \\(D_{2d}\\), in addition to the \\(a_{I}\\)_(2)_ mode, a linear spin-phonon coupling term in the \\(a_{I}\\)_(1)_ mode (i.e., the \\(b_{2u}\\) parent mode in \\(D_{4h}\\)) becomes activated. This is anticipated to be especially important for local mode contributions to decoherence, as the \\(a_{I}\\)_(1)_ mode is the lowest energy mode in these structures and thus can become populated at relatively low temperatures. Indeed, all Cu(II)-based qubits in the literature are roughly square planar, \\(D_{4h}\\). Insightful and quantitative comparisons can be drawn between the vibrational analyses of the total symmetric breathing modes of the \\(D_{4h}\\) and \\(D_{2d}\\) structures, with the latter exhibiting a larger spin-phonon coupling term. This larger coupling term occurs even though the excited state coupling term (Figure 4a) is larger than the \\(D_{2d}\\) structure. The activation of the \\(a_{I}\\)_(1)_ mode for the \\(D_{2d}\\) structure and its excited state coupling behavior can be understood via the qualitative potential energy surfaces in Figure 4b. Given the ground state structure of [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- in the absence of any structural constraints is \\(D_{2d}\\), going to the \\(D_{4h}\\) structure on the ground state surfaces results in a scenario where there is a relatively small gradient in the excited state potential energy surfaces. Thus, for the \\(D_{4h}\\) structure, there is little change in the ground state orbital angular momentum upon fluctuations in the \\(b_{2u}\\) mode that provides a coordinate between the \\(D_{4h}\\) and \\(D_{2d}\\) structures. However, the excited state potential energy surface is offset from the ground state surface near the equilibrium position of the \\(D_{2d}\\) geometry, which allows for larger changes in ground state orbital angular momentum for the \\(a_{I}\\)_(1)_ mode. #### 2.2.3 Cu(II) Effective Decoherence Maps and Comparisons to Ligand Field Theory. For \\(D_{2d}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)-, the vibrational modes with by far the largest spin-phonon coupling terms were those of \\(a_{I}\\)_(1)_ and \\(a_{I}\\)_(2)_ symmetry, and are consequently expected to be the most impactful to the quantum decoherence of Cu(II) complexes. The \\(a_{I}\\)_(1)_ mode can be described by the Cl-Cu-Cl bond angle, \\(\\alpha\\), while the \\(a_{I}\\)_(2)_ mode can be described by the Cu-Cl bond distance. Effective decoherence maps have been generated spanning this space of [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- geometries (Figure 6 (a-c)). In Figure 6, the magnitude and direction of g\\({}_{x}\\)-value gradients (i.e., effective linear spin-phonon coupling terms in this space) are represented by the size and directions of the arrows on the plot. The horizontal and vertical components of the arrows reflect the relative contributions to the \\(a_{I}\\)_(2)_ and \\(a_{I}\\)_(1)_ modes, respectively. It is evident from this representation that, for the \\(D_{4h}\\) structure, the gradient in g\\({}_{x}\\)-value is small for any linear combination of these two structural coordinates. However, upon increasing the angle, \\(\\alpha\\), the gradient in g\\({}_{x}\\) systematically increases. This reflects the larger slope of the g\\({}_{x}\\)-value vs. Cu-Cl bond length observed for \\(D_{2d}\\) (0.612 g\\({}_{x}\\)/A) vs. \\(D_{4h}\\) (0.482 g/A) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)-. This map is expected to translate to any four coordinate Cu(II) complex. Indeed, previous EPR experiments on a large scope of Cu(II) complexes have concluded that spin relaxation rates are faster for tetrahedrally-distorted geometries vs. square planar geometries [69]. This observation is fully supported by extension of the model derived here (seeFigure S19).The 2D maps are also presented for spin density and the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{2g}\\)/\\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{1}\\) ligand field transition energies, wherein the trends in both cases track with expressions in Section 2.1. Individual ligand field contributions from the ligand field transition energy and spin density are given in Figures 6B and 6C, respectively. Even though the excited state linear coupling term of the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{2g}\\) excited state (in \\(D_{4h}\\)) is larger than the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{1}\\) state (in \\(D_{2d}\\)) (also compare blue lines in Figure 4A), the resultant effect on the gradient in g\\({}_{z}\\)-value is smaller because the initial \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{2g}\\) state is higher in energy than the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{1}\\) state. Furthermore, the effective decoherence map generated using the Cu spin density (Figure 6C) shows that the gradient of the change in absolute value of the spin density increases with increasing angle, \\(\\alpha\\). This behavior is similar to Figure 6A for g\\({}_{z}\\). While it",

The energies, symmetry labels, and scaled vector displacements for all 12 normal modes of vibration are given in Table S6. Spin-phonon calculations for the g\\({}_{x}\\)-value of \\(C_{\\mathcal{U}}\\)[VOCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- are given in Figure 7A, and their fits are given in Table S7a. A strong coupling term for the g\\({}_{x}\\)-value is observed for the totally symmetric \\(a_{l}\\)_(2)_ V(IV)-Cl breathing mode (mode 9, 323 cm-1). The linear fits provide slopes of 0.068 g/\\(Q_{i}\\) and -0.130 g/A. These slopes are significantly smaller than those observed for \\(a_{lg}\\)/\\(a_{l}\\)_(2)_ modes of either \\(D_{4h}\\) (-0.241 g/\\(Q_{i}\\) and 0.482 g/A) or \\(D_{2d}\\) (-0.306 g/\\(Q_{i}\\) and 0.612 g/A) [CuCl4]2. The ratios of the \\(C_{\\nu}\\) [VOCl4]2- and \\(D_{4h}\\) [CuCl4]2- slopes are \\(\\sim\\)0.27. This is very similar to the relative magnitudes of the V(IV) (250 cm-1) and Cu(II) (-830 cm-1) SOC constants (0.3). This shows that spin-phonon coupling terms of V(IV) are systematically decreased by a factor of \\(\\sim\\)3.3, largely due to the reduced SOC constant of V(IV) relative to Cu(II). For C4v [VOCl4]2-, of the other vibrations with energies less than \\(a_{l}\\)_(2)_, modes 1 (\\(b_{l}\\)_(1)_, -51 cm-1), 2/3 (\\(e\\)_(1a, 1b)_, 160 cm-1), 4 (\\(a_{l}\\)_(1)_, 166 cm-1), 5 (\\(b_{2}\\), 187 cm-1), 6 (\\(b_{l}\\)_(2)_, 233 cm-1), 7/8 (\\(e\\)_(2a, 2b)_, 267 cm-1) all exhibit quadratic coupling terms. From low to high energy, the largest quadratic coupling terms are observed for modes \\(b_{l}\\)_(1)_ (-0.016 g/\\(Q_{i}\\)), \\(e\\)_(1a, 1b)_ (-0.020 g/\\(Q_{i}\\)), \\(a_{l}\\)_(1)_ (-0.018 g/\\(Q_{i}\\)), \\(b_{l}\\)_(2)_ (-0.016 g/\\(Q_{i}\\)), and \\(e\\)_(2a, 2b)_ (0.017 g/\\(Q_{i}\\)). These quadratic coefficients are significantly less than the important low-energy quadratic modes in \\(D_{4h}\\) [CuCl4]2-, which ranged from 0.056 to 0.118 g/\\(Q_{i}\\). When scaled for the different SOC constant of V(IV), the quadratic coefficients for [VOCl4]2- range from 0.054 to 0.067 g/\\(Q_{i}\\), which are much closer to the those for \\(D_{4h}\\) [CuCl4]2-. For more direct comparison, the coefficient of the \\(b_{2u}\\) mode of \\(D_{4h}\\) [CuCl4]2- is 0.063 g/\\(Q_{i}\\), while for the \\(b_{l}\\)_(1)_ mode of [VOCl4]2- is -0.016 g/\\(Q_{i}\\). Also, the coefficient of the \\(a_{2u}\\) mode of \\(D_{4h}\\) [CuCl4]2- is 0.119 g/\\(Q_{i}\\), while for the \\(a_{l}\\)_(1)_ mode of [VOCl4]2- is -0.018 g/\\(Q_{i}\\). From group theory, these modes correlate between the \\(D_{4h}\\) and \\(C_{\\nu}\\) point groups. For example, the \\(a_{2u}\\) mode involves out-of-plane Cu motion, while the \\(a_{l}\\)_(1)_ mode involves movement of the vandyl unit out-of-plane with respect to the chloride ligands. Thus, the spin-phonon coupling terms of both linear and quadratic modes are significantly less for the vandyl complex relative to the Cu(II) complexes. Scaled for angle change, the absolute values of the \\(b_{2u}\\) and \\(b_{l}\\)_(1)_ slopes are 0.98 x 10-4 (g/\\({}^{\\circ}\\)) and 0.28 x 10-4 (g/\\({}^{\\circ}\\)), respectively, with the \\(b_{2u}\\) mode being larger by a factor of 3.5. Scaled for metal displacement, the absolute values of the \\(a_{2u}\\) and \\(a_{l}\\)_(1)_ slopes are 0.216 and 0.077 (g/A), respectively, with the \\(a_{2u}\\) mode being larger by a factor of \\(\\sim\\)2.8. In both cases, the difference in slope is strongly influenced by the ratio of the SOC constant. Vibrational analyses of the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{1}\\) excited state energies were also carried out for \\(C_{\\nu}\\) [VOCl4]2-. Comparisons between experimental and calculated ligand field transitions are given are Table 4. Experimentally, the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{1}\\), \\({}^{2}\\)E, and \\({}^{2}\\)A\\({}_{1}\\) ligand field transitions of \\(C_{\\nu}\\) [VOCl4]2- are observed at \\(\\sim\\)12000, 13700, and 22000 cm-1, respectively.[71] The \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{2}\\)\\(\\rightarrow\\)\\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{1}\\) transition provides the SOC of orbital angular momentum for g\\({}_{2}\\), while the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{2}\\rightarrow{}^{2}\\)E transition provides SOC for g\\({}_{x,y}\\) (Figure 1). A TDDFT calculation gives the energies of these transitions at 15080 and 16325 cm-1, respectively, in fairly good agreement. The vibrational analysis of the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{1}\\) ligand field excited state is given in Figure 8b, with fits given in Table S7a. As with the g\\({}_{x}\\)-value analysis, the totally symmetric _a\\({}_{I}\\)(2)_ mode exhibits the largest coupling term. The slope of the _a1(2)_ mode is 13945 cm\\({}^{\\text{-1}}\\)/\\(Q_{i}\\) (-26450 cm\\({}^{\\text{-1}}\\)/A). These values are similar to those of \\(D_{4h}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{\\text{-2}}\\) (12405 cm\\({}^{\\text{-1}}\\)/\\(Q_{i}\\) or -24940 cm\\({}^{\\text{-1}}\\)/A). However, despite having similar ligand field excited state energies (14475 vs. 15080 cm\\({}^{\\text{-1}}\\)) and slopes (-26450 and -24940 cm\\({}^{\\text{-1}}\\)/A) for the totally symmetric stretch, the corresponding slopes for the change in g\\({}_{\\text{z}}\\)-value are significantly lower for [VOCI\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{\\text{-2}}\\) vs. [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{\\text{-2}}\\) (-0.130 g\\({}_{\\text{z}}\\)/A vs. 0.482 g\\({}_{\\text{z}}\\)/A, respectively). This difference is due to the different ratio of SOC constants for V(IV) and Cu(II). The total Loewdin unoccupied V(IV) d(xy) character and V(IV) spin density for [VOCI\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{\\text{-2}}\\) are 88 % and 0.98, respectively. As expected, the covalency of the V(IV)-Cl bonds are significantly lower than those of \\(D_{4h}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{\\text{-2}}\\) (e.g., 88 % vs. 65 % unoccupied metal d character). The spin density vibrational analysis for \\(C_{\\mathcal{H}v}\\) [VOCI\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{\\text{-2}}\\) is given in Figure S14, with fits given in Table S7e. The fits for the _a1(2)_ mode give values of -0.102 SD/\\(Q_{i}\\) and 0.194 SD/A. These values are smaller than those observed for \\(D_{4h}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{\\text{-2}}\\) (-0.157 SD/\\(Q_{i}\\) and 0.221 SD/A), consistent with the \\(\\sigma\\) overlap in [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{\\text{-2}}\\) (Figure 1). The spin density change for [VOCI\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{\\text{-2}}\\) is due to the \\(\\pi\\)-type interaction between the out-of-plane Cl p orbitals and the V d(xy) orbital. The spin-phonon coupling terms for the g\\({}_{\\text{x},\\text{y}}\\)-values for the \\(C_{\\mathcal{H}v}\\) structure are given in Figure S15, with the corresponding fits given in Table S7b and S7c. Both g\\({}_{\\text{x}}\\) and g\\({}_{\\text{y}}\\) give similar results, and only g\\({}_{\\text{x}}\\) is considered. As observed for \\(D_{4h}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{\\text{-2}}\\), the spin-phonon coupling terms are different in the g\\({}_{\\text{\\perp}}\\) region relative to g\\({}_{\\text{\\parallel}}\\). For the most part, the magnitudes of the spin-phonon coupling terms are decreased going from g\\({}_{\\text{\\parallel}}\\) to g\\({}_{\\text{\\perp}}\\). For instance, the slope of the _a1(2)_ mode decreases from 0.068 to 0.005 g\\({}_{\\text{z}}\\)/\\(Q_{i}\\), and the slopes of the _b1(1)_ and _a1(1)_ modes go from -0.016 and -0.018 g\\({}_{\\text{z}}\\)/\\(Q_{i}\\) to -0.002 and -0.007 g\\({}_{\\text{z}}\\)/\\(Q_{i}\\), respectively. The _b2_ and _e(2a, 2b)_ modes exhibit an increase in coupling term (0.017 to -0.032 g\\({}_{\\text{z}}\\)/\\(Q_{i}\\)). These changes in spin-phonon coupling terms are correlated to the changes in the slopes of the ligand field transitions. The vibrational analyses of the \\({}^{\\text{2}}\\)E ligand field excited state energies are given in Figure S16. For instance, for the _b2_ mode, the excited state slope changes from -565 to 3775 cm\\({}^{\\text{-1}}\\)/\\(Q_{i}\\). For the _e(2a, 2b)_ modes, the slopes go from 1370 to -5945/-9620 cm\\({}^{\\text{-1}}\\)/\\(Q_{i}\\). In summary, the totally symmetric _a1(2)_ mode exhibits a strong spin-phonon coupling term for \\(C_{\\mathcal{H}v}\\) [VOCI\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{\\text{2}}\\). This makes for an insightful comparison to the _a1g_ mode of \\(D_{4h}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{\\text{-2}}\\). The magnitude of the spin-phonon coupling term is significantly less for [VOCI\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{\\text{2}}\\). This difference in spin-phonon coupling terms could be quantified to a factor of \\(\\sim\\)0.27, which is ascribed here to the difference in SOC constants for V(IV) vs. Cu(II). Importantly, [VOCI\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{\\text{2}}\\) and [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{\\text{2}}\\) have similar ligand field excited state energies and similar excited state coupling terms, and [VOCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- has a smaller slope in covalency, which is due to different relative orbital overlaps for the two complexes. These observations further support that the reduced SOC constant reduces the spin-phonon coupling terms. Also, as observed for [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)-, the spin-phonon coupling terms in [VOCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- are anisotropic, with different modes being activated in the g\\({}_{\\parallel}\\) and g\\({}_{\\perp}\\) regions. Nonetheless, the spin-phonon coupling terms of [VOCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)-, even when scaled for degree of distortion, are significantly reduced relative to [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- in either g\\({}_{\\parallel}\\) and g\\({}_{\\perp}\\) directions. The reduced spin-phonon coupling terms will play a major role in the room temperature coherence properties of vanadyl complexes relative to Cu(II) complexes. ## 3 Discussion. Transition metal complexes are being explored as qubits for quantum computing. In addition to significant hurdles related to the eventual quantum entanglement of molecular qubits, spin-phonon coupling in transition metal complexes often prohibits the observation of room temperature coherence properties. This has inspired resent research efforts to better understand the nature of spin-phonon coupling in transition metal complexes and how it might be tuned and controlled by variations in the ligand set and thus the ligand field environment.[13, 14, 15, 33, 44] As highlighted in the Introduction, spin-phonon couplings also play important roles in single molecule magnets and photophysics, and studies directed at fundamental understanding will have broad impact. Above, we have outlined a general LFT model of spin-phonon coupling terms in S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) transition metal complexes. This model is derived from the first and second derivatives of the LFT expressions of g-values given in Section 2.1[54]. While these expressions define the zero temperature magnitudes of spin-phonon coupling terms in S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) complexes, they can be expanded to consider additional dynamic effects through the variance of g\\({}_{z}\\), \\(\\langle g_{z}^{2}\\rangle\\), which highlights the importance of the first derivative, \\(\\frac{\\partial g_{z}}{\\partial q_{l}}\\), and therefore its role in the coherence lifetimes of S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) transition metal complexes. This suggests that, without considering thermal population, odd modes such as totally symmetric stretches will have a more substantial effect on spin-phonon coupling terms and decoherence compared to even modes, in which their value of relevance, \\(\\frac{\\partial^{2}g_{z}}{\\partial q_{l}^{2}}\\), only appears in the second order term of the Taylor expansion (equation 5). The fundamental behavior of these expressions were borne out by an extensive range of DFT and TD-DFT calculations on minimalistic S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) models, \\(D_{4h}\\)/\\(D_{2d}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- and \\(C_{\\mathcal{H}}\\) [VOCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)-. Together, the results above provide a general description of the roles of transition metal geometric and electronic structure in spin-phonon coupling. For instance, the magnitudes of spin-phonon coupling terms are strongly influenced by excited state SOC of orbital angular momentum into the ground state and are predicted to be strongly influenced by the energy of the particular ligand field excited state mixing with the ground state (equations 6 and 7) (e.g., \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{2g}\\) for a \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{1g}\\) ground state in \\(D_{4h}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)-). This excited state SOC contribution is governed by the ligand field geometry about the metal complex. For example, going from \\(D_{4h}\\) to \\(D_{2d}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- turns on additional mode coupling terms due to the enhancement of excited state coupling terms (Figure 4). Furthermore, the magnitude of spin-phonon coupling terms are strongly influenced by the covalency of ligand-metal bonds. This dynamic effect largely reflects a relativistic nephelauxetic effect, which effectively modulates the SOC constant of the metal from that of the free ion. In short, the more covalent the ligand-metal bond, the smaller the spin-phonon coupling terms become. Relatedly, a significant overall reduction in SOC constant can of course be achieved through the use of different transition metal complexes (e.g., V(IV) vs. Cu(II) vs. Cr(V)). As shown below, V(IV), which has a significantly lower SOC constant than Cu(II), can still maintain favorable spin-phonon coupling terms despite having significantly more ionic ligand-metal bonds than Cu(II) complexes. Complications can also arise from trying to quantify spin-phonon coupling terms in different ligand field environments, as the nature of the modes can change. However, this can be facilitated to some degree by leveraging specific group theoretical correlations as demonstrated here for \\(D_{4h}\\), \\(D_{2d}\\), and \\(C_{\\mathcal{H}}\\) transition metal complexes. The spin-phonon analyses presented above for [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- and [VOCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- are now extended to a range of S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) Cu(II) and V(IV) molecular qubit candidates. ### 3.1 Extension to Cu(II)- and V(IV)-Based Qubits. The spin-phonon analyses of the Cu(II) qubit complexes and their g\\({}_{x}\\)-values are given in Figures S17(a-d) and Tables S8(a-d). The spin-phonon analyses of the V(IV) complexes and their g\\({}_{x}\\)-values for all modes up to at least 400 cm-1 in energy are given in Figures S18(a-f) and Tables S9(a-f). Comparisons between all geometry optimized and crystal structures are given in Tables S10(a,b) and S11(a-c) for Cu(II) and V(IV) complexes, respectively. Providing quantitative comparisons between the spin-phonon analyses for different complexes is a complicated task. This is largely because the nature and",

            "input_text": "amount of atomic motions are not necessarily conserved over all vibrations. However, as discussed here, the modes identified above for \\(D_{th}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- and \\(C_{\\mathcal{H}v}\\) [VOC\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- that exhibited particularly large spin-phonon coupling terms are also those that exhibit spin-phonon coupling terms in the qubits. Thus, the parent vibrational modes provide a means to make quantitative comparisons across Cu(II) and V(IV) complexes. The experimental and calculated g-values of Cu(II) qubits are given in Table 1,[14, 33, 72, 73] while spin-phonon linear coupling terms and additional computational results are given in Table 5. Note X-ray crystal structures were utilized for [Cu(mnt)\\({}_{2}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)-, [Cu(bdt)\\({}_{2}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)-, and [Cu(bds)\\({}_{2}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- (bds = benzene-1,2-diselenate) complexes, as their structures were not well reproduced using DFT geometry optimization. However, CuPc provided a good agreement and thus the optimized structure is used. As outlined above, the totally symmetric stretch (\\(a_{lg}\\) in \\(D_{th}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)-) and the out-of-plane motion of the metal/vanadyl moiety (\\(a_{2u}\\) in \\(D_{th}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- and \\(a_{I}\\)(1) in \\(C_{\\mathcal{H}v}\\) [VOC\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)-) were the main modes to consider. The nature of these modes are well conserved over the complexes considered in Tables 5 and 6 and allow for the spin-phonon coupling terms to be compared on a A-1 scale. As elucidated above, the linear coupling terms for the totally symmetric modes of \\(D_{th}\\) and \\(D_{2d}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- were determined to be 0.482 and 0.612 g/A. These modes for qubit candidates CuPc,[74] Cu(mnt)\\({}_{2}\\),[50] Cu(bdt)\\({}_{2}\\),[33] and Cu(bds)\\({}_{2}\\)[33] are 0.464, 0.384, 0.232, and 0.165 g/A, respectively. Interestingly, of these qubits, Cu(bdt)\\({}_{2}\\) exhibited spin echoes that persist to room temperature, and it has one of the lowest spin-phonon coupling terms of the Cu(II) complexes, with only Cu(bds)\\({}_{2}\\) being lower. Note the lack of spin echoes for Cu(bds)\\({}_{2}\\) and its comparison to Cu(bdt)\\({}_{2}\\) is discussed further below. For the \\(a_{2u}\\) parent mode, the quadratic coefficients for \\(D_{4h}\\) and \\(D_{2d}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\) were determined to be 0.216 and 0.529 g/A, respectively. In a similar fashion to the \\(a_{lg}\\) parent mode, the quadratic coefficients of the \\(a_{2u}\\) parent mode decrease to 0.151, 0.102, 0.103, and 0.039 g/A for CuPc, Cu(mnt)\\({}_{2}\\), Cu(bdt)\\({}_{2}\\), and Cu(bds)\\({}_{2}\\), respectively. Thus, there is a systematic decrease in the spin-phonon coupling terms across these Cu(II) complexes. These observations can be understood utilizing the LFT model outlined above. For example, Cu(bdt)\\({}_{2}\\) exhibits the highest calculated ligand field excited state energy (29700 cm\\({}^{-1}\\)) and has highly covalent ligand-metal bonds (41 % Cu(d)). The decreased slope of Cu(bds)\\({}_{2}\\) is due to the increased covalency of the Cu-Se vs. Cu-S bonds (Table 5). Furthermore, the slopes and quadratic coefficients of Cu(mnt)\\({}_{2}\\) are larger than those Cu(bdt)\\({}_{2}\\) and Cu(bds)\\({}_{2}\\). From Table 5, this is largely reflected by the lower excited state energy (22305 cm\\({}^{-1}\\)) (and thus the higher amount of ground state orbital angular momentum) and, to a smaller extent, the lower covalency (42 % Cu(d)). The slopes and coefficients for CuPc are increased further relative to the other Cu(II) complexes, as the Cu-N bonds are significantly more ionic than the Cu-S bonds of Cu(mnt)\\({}_{2}\\), Cu(bdt)\\({}_{2}\\) and Cu(bds)\\({}_{2}\\). These electronic differences between Cu(bdt)\\({}_{2}\\) and Cu(mnt)\\({}_{2}\\) can be understood from their X-ray crystal structures. For example, the Cu-S bond lengths of Cu(mnt)\\({}_{2}\\) are \\(\\sim\\)2.33 A, which are longer than those for the Cu(bdt)\\({}_{2}\\) complex (\\(\\sim\\)2.15 A). For Cu(bdt)\\({}_{2}\\), the contraction of the ligand-metal bonds destabilizes the Cu d(x\\({}^{2}\\)-y\\({}^{2}\\)) \\(\\beta\\)-LUMO orbital, which increases the energy of the \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{2\\rm g}\\) ligand field transition and increases the orbital overlap (covalency) of the ligand-metal bonds (Figure 1). Thus, the ligand set and Cu(bdt)\\({}_{2}\\) complex exhibits the ideal characteristics for a Cu(II)-based qubit. Also, while the slopes of the Cu(bds)\\({}_{2}\\) complex would suggest longer coherence times, the lack of spin echoes at higher temperatures can be attributed to the significant decrease in the vibrational frequency of the \\(a_{lg}\\) parent mode due to the mass effect of the S to Se conversion (e.g., 387 vs. 199 cm\\({}^{-1}\\), respectively). Interestingly, the fits to the temperature dependence of the \\(T_{I}\\) for these complexes suggest local mode contributions of 488 \\(\\pm\\) 72 and 344 \\(\\pm\\) 80 cm\\({}^{-1}\\). Combined with the computational results here, these frequencies and their differences provide strong evidence that the totally symmetric \\(a_{lg}\\) parent mode contributes to the coherence times of Cu(II) complexes. Thus, we propose that the rapidly accessible data in Table 5 can be computed to qualitatively and semi-quantitatively evaluate and screen potential Cu(II)-based qubits. Recent work by Sessoli et al. [13, 53] has highlighted the important role of the vanadyl moiety in V(IV)-based qubits. The calculated and experimental g-values of a variety of vandyl and V(IV)qubits are given in Table 3[75, 76, 77, 43, 43, 70] Their spin-phonon analyses are given in Figures S18(a-f) and Tables S9(a-f), and specific spin-phonon slopes and additional computational results are given in Table 6. Note, of the vandyl complexes considered here, VOPc, VO(acac)\\({}_{2}\\), and [VO(cat)\\({}_{2}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- were geometry optimized. Similarly to the Cu complexes considered above, X-ray crystal structures were used for structures where geometry optimizations resulted in significantly different structures (e.g., [VO(dmit)\\({}_{2}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)-, [V(bdt)\\({}_{3}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)-, and [V(bds)\\({}_{3}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)-). Experimentally, long coherence times have been observed for a variety of vandyl complexes. However, only VOPc has been directly studied in a solid diamagnetic matrix, which has thus far prohibited further investigation of vandyl complexes up to room temperature. From the data given in Table 6, there are currently no clear defining characteristics to be observed across the vandyl complexes. Thus, other vandyl complexes, when isolated in similar solid diamagnetic matrices, will likely exhibit long relaxation times, with the potential for room temperature coherence. The spin-phonon model presents a stark difference for vandyl vs. six coordinate V(IV) complexes. As shown in Sessoli et al.[13, 53], six coordinate V(IV) complexes do not exhibit long \\(T_{I}\\)s at elevated temperatures. Very recently, Albino et al.[13] pointed to the role of increased excited state SOC in six coordinate complexes relative to vandyl complexes. Furthermore, Fataftah et al.[33] compared six coordinate V(IV) complexes to Cu(II) complexes to suggest the role of increased covalency in elongating \\(T_{I}\\) relaxation lifetimes. Here we have extended our LFT model to the V(bdt)\\({}_{3}\\) and V(bds)\\({}_{3}\\) complexes studied by Fataftah et al.[33] (Table 6). Interestingly, as pointed out by Albino et al.[13] for other six coordinate V(IV) complexes, the V(bdt)\\({}_{3}\\) and V(bds)\\({}_{3}\\) complexes exhibit very low energy calculated ligand field transitions (7935 and 6785 cm-1, respectively). Furthermore, the totally symmetric stretches of these complexes were computed at 351.7 and 209.8 cm-1, respectively. These modes allow for a quantitative comparison between the linear spin-phonon coupling term of Cu(II) complexes on a A-1 scale. The linear coupling terms for V(bds)\\({}_{6}\\) in the g\\({}_{\\parallel}\\) and g\\({}_{\\perp}\\) regions are -0.420 and -0.357 g/A, respectively. For comparison, the linear coupling term of the totally symmetric \\(a_{lg}\\) parent mode of Cu(bdt)\\({}_{2}\\) is smaller (0.232 g/A). Also, the calculated vibrational frequency decreases and the linear coupling terms increase going from V(bdt)\\({}_{3}\\) to V(bds)\\({}_{3}\\). Thus, the longer spin-lattice relaxation time at higher temperatures for Cu(bdt)\\({}_{2}\\) vs. V(bdt)\\({}_{3}\\) is not due to differences in ligand-metal covalency, but rather stems from efficient excited state SOC as a result of the relatively low energy ligand field transition energies for V(bdt)\\({}_{3}\\). This is further supported by the observation of room temperature coherence in vandylcomplexes,[37] despite ionic ligand metal bonding. Together, these DFT/TDDFT calculations are consistent with the LFT model derived here and further highlight the importance of considering both excited state SOC and ligand-metal covalency when comparing different complexes with different metals and/or coordination environments. ### Ligand Field Strain in Qubits. As previously highlighted for \\(D_{4h}/D_{2d}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)-, the planar \\(D_{4h}\\) Cu(II) structure represents a saddle point on the ground state potential energy surface that can only be stabilized in the presence of crystal packing forces.[57, 58] The formation of this structure in [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- was likened to the nematic/rack state in bioinorganic chemistry, where the protein architecture (inclusive of first and second sphere contributions, as well as long range H-bonding and electrostatics) can place a metal ion in a strained ligand field.[78, 79, 80, 81] This ligand field strain can generate unique properties. The entic/rack state and ligand field strain is therefore of relevance to molecular qubits. For example, Cu(II)-based complexes with the longest coherence times are square planar Cu(II) sites stabilized in diamagnetic lattices (e.g., Cu(mnt)\\({}_{2}\\)[50] and Cu(bdt)\\({}_{2}\\)[33]). The geometric dependence to \\(T_{I}\\) was also noted in an EPR study of a variety of Cu(II) complexes.[69] Here we have shown that the origin of this dependence for the square planar Cu(II) geometry derives from the significant minimization of excited state coupling terms, which reduces dynamic SOC of orbital angular momentum into the ground state (Figure 4). In addition to crystal packing forces, variations in the ligand set can effectively control the deviation from planarity in Cu(II) complexes. This can be observed directly in the dependence of the electronic energy as a function of the \\(b_{2u}\\) parent mode (in \\(D_{4h}\\)) distortion. For instance, as noted above, distortion along this mode will decrease the energy for the square planar Cu(II) complexes studied here, which results in the \\(b_{2u}\\) mode being imaginary. However, this is not the case for CuPc. Thus, linking the four N-based ligands into the aromatic planar structure of the Pc ligand provides an entictic state that can oppose distortions along the \\(b_{2u}\\) parent mode. However, the drawback of the Pc ligand arises also from its N-based coordination, which gives rise to fairly ionic ligand-metal bonds and opposes the effects provided by the rigid and constrained ligand field (i.e., entic state). In relation, significant efforts have been guided toward better identifying, understanding, and quantifying entictic states,[82, 83, 84] which have traditionally been used to rationalize electron transfer properties. However, given the general nature of this description, it is being extended toother scenarios, including photochemistry and catalysis [85, 86, 87, 88, 89]. Strain effects have also been discussed in the context of both ground and excited states and their contributions to the coherence properties in solid state qubits (e.g, vacancies in diamond) [10, 11, 12, 90]. Thus, engineering ligand field strain and rigidity into covalent environments will be useful for advancing the geometric and electronic structural contributions to the quantum coherence of transition metal complexes, and the model outlined here can guide these future investigations. ## 4 Conclusion. The spin-phonon coupling terms of minimalized \\(D_{4h}\\)/\\(D_{2d}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)] [2]- and \\(C_{4v}\\) [VOC\\({}_{4}\\)] [2]- complexes translate onto Cu(II)- and V(IV)-based molecular qubits and are dominated by three major factors: 1) the magnitude of the metal-based SOC constant, 2) the initial magnitude and gradient of change in ground state orbital angular momentum, which is governed by the ligand field excited state energies, and 3) dynamic relativistic nephelauxetic contributions, including the initial magnitude and gradient in the covalency of the ligand-metal bonds. Factors 1) and 3) are directly related, as covalency further reduces the SOC constant of a metal in a complex relative to that of the free ion. LFT expressions derived here predict spin-phonon coupling terms in both odd and even modes are important to consider for decoherence times (equation 5). However, odd modes such as the totally symmetric stretch play a key role for decoherence times. We have further shown how the LFT expressions and thus spin-phonon coupling terms (equations 6 and 7) can be directly related to spectroscopic observables and calculable quantities. For Cu(II), key geometric and symmetry factors, including ligand field strain, significantly lower excited state coupling terms while simultaneously increasing orbital overlap and ligand-metal covalency. Importantly, all factors relating to excited state SOC and covalency need to be evaluated when comparing spin-phonon coupling terms, including local mode contributions to \\(T_{I}\\) and \\(T_{m}\\) relaxation times, of various metal complexes. The model outlined here provides a means to quantify spin-phonon coupling terms for given vibrational modes for any S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) molecule, providing a powerful means to benchmark current and future qubit candidates. The further discovery of room temperature coherent materials will provide exciting opportunities to develop fundamental structure-function correlations for spin-phonon coupling in transition metal complexes.

The quadratic coefficients exhibit a systematic decrease across the series, suggesting a reduced spin-phonon interaction.\n\nThe nature of these modes remains consistent across the complexes, allowing for quantitative comparisons. The LFT model, discussed earlier, aids in understanding this behavior. For instance, the copper(II) complex with the highest calculated ligand field excited state energy, Cu(bdt)\\(_2\\), exhibits a lower slope in its \\(a_{2u}\\) mode due to increased covalency in its metal-ligand bonds.

Their g-values and spin-phonon analysis, presented in Table 3 and Figures S18- S18, reveal distinct characteristics compared to copper(II) complexes. The vanadyl moiety, despite having fewer coordinating atoms, can lead to long coherence times, as seen in VOPc.

            "input_text": "###### Abstract Synthetic challenges toward anomalous structures and electronic states often involve handling problems such as insolubility in common organic solvents and oxidative degradation under aerobic conditions. We designed benzo-annulated aza[n]helicenes, which benefit from both the suppressed elevation of HOMO energies and high solubility due to hydrogen-bonding with solvent molecules to overcome these challenges. This strategy enabled the synthesis of six new aza[n]helicenes ([n]AHs) of different lengths (n = 9-19) from acyclic precursors via one-shot oxidative fusion reactions. The structures of all the synthesized aza[n]helicenes were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, and their electrochemical potentials were measured by cyclic voltammetry. Among the synthesized aza[n]helicenes, [17]AH and [19]AH are the first hetero-helicenes with a triple-layered helix. The noncovalent interaction (NCI) plots confirm the existence of an effective n-n interaction between the layers. The absorption and fluorescence spectra red-shifted as the helical lengths increased, without any distinct saturation points. The optical resolutions of _N_-butylated [9]AH, and [11]AH were accomplished and their circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) were measured. Thus, the structural, (chir)optical, and electrochemical properties of the aza[n]helicenes were comprehensively analyzed. ## Introduction Helicene is a class of chiral n-conjugated molecules with a screw-shaped skeleton formed by _ortho_-fused benzene rings (_i.e._, phenanthrene units) that has been actively studied.[1] In addition to the chiroptical properties such as circular dichroism (CD) and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL),[2] their physical properties as molecular springs[3] and the CISS effect[4] are cutting-edge functionalities based on the helical molecular scaffold. When focusing on the lengths of [n]carbholeicenes, it is assumed that the overlap of the n-planes becomes more significant by forming a layered structure; double layered at n = 7 and triple layered at n = 13. In 2015, [16]carbobielcene (A) was synthesized by Murase and Fujita, and this is the longest [n]carbobielcene ever synthesized (Figure 1).[5] The synthesis of longer helicenes has been desired simply as a synthetic challenge and various improved synthetic methods have been devised.[1-6] Helicenes comprising more than triple-layered structures are particularly difficult to synthesize, because of solubility issues, and because the middle-layered core is tightly compressed, making it difficult to release the strain. Recently, several longer helicene analogues that can release the strain by virtue of their structure have been developed. For example, expanded helicenes, in which phenanthrene units are partially replaced by anthracine units to increase the diameter of helicenes,[6] and perylene bisimide-incorporated helicenes (helicene nanoribbons) have been synthesized.[7] These \"diameter-expanded\" helicene analogues display interesting dynamic behavior and chiroptical properties. Tilly's group synthesized expanded [n]helicenes (B) with three different lengths (n = 15, 19, 23), and compared the racemization barriers and dissymmetry factors.[8] By contrast, Hirose and Matsuda have reported \"n-extended\" [n]carbobielcenes (C) with three different lengths (n = 5, 7, 9), and compared their chiroptical properties, aromaticity, and ultrafast dynamics in the excited state.[9] As another type of helicene analog, heterobielcenes, in which heteroatoms are embedded into the helicene backbones, have also attracted attention because of their excellent luminescence and redox properties.[10; 11] Generally, heterohelicenes are more electron-rich compared with carbobielcenes, thus their HOMO energy levels are continuously destabilized with the n-extension. Therefore, it is more difficult to synthesize longer heterohelicenes with full conjugation, whereas several heterohelicenes with a double-layered structure have been synthesized; one example is diazatri-oxa-[13]helicene D.[12] Furthermore, a triple-layered structure was accomplished with oxa[n]helicene E (n = 17, 19) albeit with disrupted n-conjugation.[13] To qualitatively evaluate the electronic properties of helicenes, however, it is necessary to systematically synthesize fully conjugated heterohelicenes of different lengths, therefore, a synthetic strategy toward longer heterohelicene would be indispensable. Currently, few systematic synthetic methods are available for the synthesis of heterohelicenes. We recently reported one-shot oxidative fusion reactions of _ortho_-phenylene-bridged oligopyrcles to afford various heterocirculenes and heterohelicenes.[14; 15] Notably, tetrazza[8]circulenes, with planar structures excluding any sterically encumbering substituents, are fairly soluble in THF and DMSO.[16] This property arises from effective hydrogen-bonding interactions between the pyrrol NH site and the H-bond accepting solvent molecule. Inspired by this molecular design principle, we report a synthetic challenge for longer azahelicenes with outer-pointing pyrrolic NH sites. By exploiting the one-shot oxidative fusion reactions of suitably designed indole-terminated acyclic oligopyrroles (_wide infra_), a series of benzannulated aza[n]helicenes were obtained. This structure is suitable for suppressing the elevation of the HOMO energy levels by virtue of Clar's sextet rule.[17] In other words, the designed benzannulated aza[1]helicenes are an ideal platform to accomplish longer fully conjugated hetero[n]helicenes with respect to solubility and stability issues. Comprehensive characterizations by NMR, UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy, electrochemistry, as well as CD and CPL spectra of the enantiomers revealed the \\(\\pi\\)-conjugation along the helix and between the layers. ## Results and Discussion Synthesis of aza[n]helicenes. In our previous study on the synthesis of dibenzoaz[7]helicenes, acyclic precursors like \\(\\mathbf{6_{7}}\\) were effectively utilized.[19] In this study, the extended analogs \\(\\mathbf{6_{n}}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{8_{n}}\\) were synthesized using Pd-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions, followed by oxidation with [bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo]benzene (PIFA) to afford a series of benzannulated aza[n]helicenes (hereafter referred to as [n]AH) (n = 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19). In the case of aza[n]helicenes with n = 9, 13, 17, aryl bromides \\(\\mathbf{3_{m}}\\) were synthesized by Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions of excess amounts of 1-bromo-2-iodobenzene or aryl dibromide \\(\\mathbf{1_{m}}\\) with \\(\\alpha\\)-borylated indole 2 (Scheme 1). Next, aryl boronic acid pinced esters \\(\\mathbf{4_{m}}\\)-Bpin were synthesized via cross-coupling reactions of 3m with \\(\\alpha\\)-borylated pyrrole and subsequent Ir-catalyzed borolvation. Dipyrrole chloride \\(\\mathbf{5^{15}}\\) was coupled with a small excess of \\(\\mathbf{4_{m}}\\)-Bpin in the presence of 5.0 mol% XYhos Pd G2 and excess potassium carbonate in THF/H\\({}_{2}\\)O to afford the acyclic precursors \\(\\mathbf{6_{n}}\\). Finally, oxidative fusion reactions of the acyclic precursors with PIFA at low temperatures afforded the corresponding [n]AHs. For [n]AHs with n = 11, 15, 19, aryl bromides \\(\\mathbf{3_{m}}\\) were used as coupling partners. Tripyrrole diboronic acid pinacol ester \\(\\mathbf{7^{15}}\\) was coupled with a small excess of the synthesized aryl bromides \\(\\mathbf{3_{m}}\\) in the presence of 5.0 mol% XYhos Pd G2 and an excess of potassium carbonate in THF/H\\({}_{2}\\)O at room temperature to afford acyclic precursors \\(\\mathbf{8_{m}}\\) although the yields were moderate probably because of the competing protodeboronation reactions. Similarly, the oxidative fusion of acyclic precursors \\(\\mathbf{8_{n}}\\) by PIFA afforded [n]AHs. All six [n]AHs were purified using silica-gel column chromatography and recrystallization from THF/_n_-hexane in open air. All [n]AHs were characterized by 'H- and '\\({}^{3}\\)C-NMR, and HR-MS (See the Supporting Information, SI). 'H-NMR spectra of the obtained [n]AHs were measured in DMSO-\\(d_{6}\\) at room temperature with one drop of hydrazine monohydrate to prevent the generation of oxidized species.[19] For all [n]AHs, NMR spectra reflecting the \\(C_{2}\\)-symmetric structures were obtained. The terminal benzene protons (_indole-H_) shifted considerably upfield, indicating that these aromatic protons were located above other aromatic rings. Notably, upfield shifts in the signals in the aromatic region were observed as the helical length increased, probably because of the enhancement of anisotropic shielding by the \\(\\pi\\)-electron of the stacked aromatic rings (Figure S3-45). Figure 1: Various helicene analogs: longest [n]carbobilecene A, expanded helicenes B, extended helicenes C, heteroehelicenes D and E. This work: benzannulated azahelicenes of different lengths (n = 9-19). X-ray crystal structures. Fortunately, single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis were obtained by slow vapor diffusion of _n_-hexane into solutions of [n]AHs in THF, acetone, or 1,4-dioxane. The structures are shown in Figure 2A in which the solvent molecules coordinated to the NH moiety via hydrogen bonds are omitted. Because of the sophisticated molecular design, intermolecular interactions between [n]AHs were not observed in any of the structures, thereby contributing good solubility. Indeed, five and seven acetone molecules were included in the asymmetric units of [13]AH and [15]AH, respectively, (Figures S5-4, 5-5) whereas seven 1,4-dioxane molecules were included in the asymmetric unit of [19]AH (Figure S5-7). For [9]AH, the vertical distance (interplanar distance) between the centroid of terminal benzene ring A and the mean plain of the opposite terminal benzene ring I is 3.807 A. As the typical distance of \\(\\pi\\)-stacking is approximately 3.4 A, interlayer interaction between the terminal benzene rings may be minimal, similarly to that of [7]carbobilecene (3.8-3.9 A).[20] The interplanar angle between the stacked two benzene rings is approximately 40\\({}^{\\circ}\\), which also suggests that the interlayer \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interaction is weak. By contrast, for [11]AH, the longest and shortest vertical distances are 3.567 A and 3.202 A, respectively, suggesting a distinct interlayer \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interaction between the stacked aromatic rings. The interplanar angles are 16.3\\({}^{\\circ}\\), 11.6\\({}^{\\circ}\\), and 20.4\\({}^{\\circ}\\), being smaller than that of [9]AH in accordance with the effective interlayer \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions. The crystal structures of [13]AH and [15]AH are also shown in Figure 2A. As the space group is _P3\\({}_{2}\\)_ for the former and the lattice contains only one enantiomer, spontaneous chiral resolution took place for [13]AH upon crystallization. Chiral separation using HPLC apparatus is discussed later. In [13]AH and [15]AH, the shortest interplanar distances are less than 3.2 A (3.199 A and 3.176 A), and the aromatic rings are very closely packed together, again confirming the existence of effective \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions. The smallest interplanar angles are 3.3\\({}^{\\circ}\\) and 1.4\\({}^{\\circ}\\) for [13]AH and [15]AH, respectively. These values are even smaller than those of [11]AH. The crystal structures of [17]AH and [19]AH are the first examples of triple-layered fully conjugated heterobilenes. In both [17]AH and [19]AH, the shortest interplanar distances are also less than 3.2 A (3.170 A and 3.185 A, respectively), and the smallest interplanar angles are the smallest of those measured (1.2\\({}^{\\circ}\\) and 0.8\\({}^{\\circ}\\)). The interplanar angles at the ends are larger than those of the helicene central core due to the effect of electron repulsion and smaller steric constraints ([19]AH; \\(\\theta_{\\rm{A}}\\) = 19.5\\({}^{\\circ}\\), \\(\\theta_{\\rm{BN}}\\) = 0.81\\({}^{\\circ}\\)). However, at the center of the helicene core, the angles are almost 0\\({}^{\\circ}\\), because the central layers of [17]AH and [19]AH are located under large steric constraints from the top and bottom layers. After six types of crystal structures were obtained, their structural parameters of them (interplanar distance, interplanar angle, and dihedral angle) were compared with those of the obtained structures calculated at the B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-SVP level (Fig 2B).[21, 22] For all the parameters, the trend of the experimentally determined values agreed with those obtained from the theoretical calculations, which reproduced the notable changes from [9]AH to [11]AH. This result reflects the weak intramolecular \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions at the terminal aromatic ring of helicenes. A decrease in the interplanar distances or angles results in an increase in the dihedral angles, indicating that the intramolecular interactions become stronger and the aromatic rings become more densely stacked with helicene elongation, while the strain energies of the [n]AHs increase with helicene elongation. To estimate the inherent strain energy of [n]AHs, we attempted to adopt a homodesmotic reaction model.[23] Accordingly, the strain energy (_AH_) of [n]AHs increased continuously as the number _n'_ increased (Figure S7-12). These estimations are in accordance with several cases of expanded helicenes previously reported.[60] Finally, the interlayer \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions of [n]AHs between the two neighboring layers were visualized using the noncovalent interaction (NCI) plot analysis (Figures 2A and S7-11).[24] Dispersion interactions between the two stacked layers of [n]AHs are obvious (green surface shows intramolecular \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions). In particular, intramolecular \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions across three layers was confirmed for [17]AH and [19]AH. Electrochemical properties. The electrochemical properties of [n]AHs were measured using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in THF (Figure 3). All the [n]AHs exhibited reversible first oxidative waves, and the half-wave potential of [9]AH was recorded at +0.09 V against the ferrocene/ferrocenium ion couple. The longer [n]AHs exhibited negative potentials at -0.06 V for [11]AH, -0.16 V for [13]AH, -0.26 V for [15]AH, -0.38 V for [17]AH, and -0.48 V for [19]AH. The negative shift in the first oxidation potentials can be attributed to an increase in the number of electron-rich pyrrole units in the helicene core. In particular, [19]AH was confirmed to be very easily oxidized. Nevertheless, the as-synthesized [19]AH was purified using flash chromatography on silica at room temperature and recrystallized from THF/_n_-hexane, allowing the growth of single crystals under ambient conditions (_vide supra_). Molecular orbital calculations were performed for the optimized structures of [n]AH in the ground state (Figure 4). The HOMO energy level gradually increased as the helical length increased. By contrast, the LUMO energy level was not markedly affected by the elongation, resulting in a gradual decrease in the HOMO-LUMO gaps. To gain further insight into the structure-property relationship in these benzannulated aza[n] helicenes without benzannulated structures (_i.e._, [n]AH) were also calculated (Figure S7-8).[25] The HOMO energy levels of [n]AH's are generally higher than those of [n]AHs by 0.11-0.37 eV (_e.g._ -4.45 V for [19]AH vs -4.18 V for [19]AH). Therefore, as a proof-of-concept, the benzannulated molecular design principle contributes to the stabilization of",

To evaluate the aromaticity of [n]AHs, the NICS(0) value at the center of each rings was calculated using the GIAO method at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level based on the optimized structures [26]. The NICS(0) values of [9]AH and [11]AH are in the range from -6.6 to -11.6 ppm and from -6.3 to -12.3 ppm, respectively (Figure 5A). Rings 3 and 5 were relatively shielded whereas the local aromaticity in the pyrrole units (Rings 2, 4, (6)) and the terminal benzene moiety (ring 1) were dominant. The HOMA values are consistent with the local aromaticity of these rings [27]. Notably, the benzo segments (rings 6 and 7 for [9]AH and rings 7 and 8 for [11]AH) exhibit relatively deshielded features compared with the neighboring six-membered ring. The anisotropy of the induced current density (ACID) calculations [20] revealed the localized aromatic ring-current flows of the pyrrole and the annulated benzene rings in [9]AH and [11]AH as the dominant contributions (Figure 4B). These results represented Clar's sextet rule as shown in Figure 4C. Such local aromaticity suppresses the increase in the HOMO energy levels to the extent that the isolation of these molecules without any kinetically stabilizing substituents is allowed under air. The same calculations were performed for longer [n]AH and the same trend in their aromaticity was observed (Figures S7-9, S7-10). Aromaticity. To evaluate the aromaticity of [n]AHs, the NICS(0) value at the center of each rings was calculated using the GIAO method at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level based on the optimized structures [26].

Such local aromaticity suppresses the increase in the HOMO energy levels to the extent that the isolation of these molecules without any kinetically stabilizing substituents is allowed under air.

The edges of the absorption spectra are red-shifted, and the molar extinction coefficient (\\(\\varepsilon\\)) increases with helicase \\(\\pi\\)-extension. In particular, the absorption spectral edge of the longest [19]AH reaches approximately 500 nm, suggesting that the effective conjugation length (ECL) in this system was not saturated.[29] This result was supported by the HOMO-LUMO energy gaps obtained from theoretical calculations (Figure 57-7). All the aza[n]helicenes exhibited blue-to-yellow luminescence with some vibrational bands. The edges of the fluorescence spectra also show gradual red-shifts along with the helicase \\(\\pi\\)-extension. The absolute fluorescence quantum yields (\\(\\Phi_{\\mathrm{F}}\\)) tended to decrease with increasing helical length (_e.g._\\(\\Phi_{\\mathrm{F}}\\) = 0.21 for [9]AH and \\(\\phi_{\\mathrm{F}}\\) = 0.08 for [19]AH) (Figure 6C). However, even [19]AH exhibits distinct blue-green fluorescence with \\(\\Phi_{\\mathrm{F}}\\) = 0.08 as a characteristic feature of heterobilecenes. By contrast, [17]AH exhibits a high fluorescence quantum yield with \\(\\Phi_{\\mathrm{F}}\\) = 0.18, which may be attributed to its rigid structure and suppressed nonradiative deactivation as a result of the large steric constraints caused by the triple-layered structure.

The structures of all synthesized azah helicenes were determined using XRD analysis. [17]AH and [19]AH are the first heteropticleines with a triple-layered helix. The structural parameters of the helicenes (_i.e._, interplanar distance, interplanar angle, and torsion angle) were compared experimentally and theoretically. The intramolecular interactions became stronger and the aromatic rings became more densely stacked with the elongation of the helical structure. The NCI plots confirmed the existence of an effective \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interaction between the layers. Electrochemical potentials were measured using CV, and the first oxidation potential shifted to the negative side in response to helicene elongation. The absorption and fluorescence spectra red-shifted as the helical lengths increased, without any distinct saturation points. The optical resolutions of _N_-butylated [9]AH and [11]AH were accomplished, and their CD and CPL spectra were measured. The molecular design of the azah helicenes synthesized in this study solves the stability and solubility problems encountered thus far, and may provide an ideal platform for the synthesis of longer heterobilecenes.",

The AI provides visual aids, such as X-ray crystal structures and NCI plots (Figure 2), to illustrate the molecules, with solvent molecules and hydrogen atoms excluded for clarity. The comparison of structural parameters between the helicenes is presented (Figure B), highlighting the aromaticity assessment through NICS(0) calculations and HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) values.\n\nThe aromaticity of the helicenes, particularly [9]AH and [11]AH, is discussed, indicating that rings 3 and 5 are relatively shielded, while the pyrrole units and terminal benzene moiety exhibit dominant local aromaticity (Rings 2, 4, and 6, and Ring 1, respectively). Anisotropy of induced current density (ACID) calculations further confirm the presence of localized aromatic ring currents (Figure 4B), aligning with Clar's sextet rule (Figure 4C).

            "input_text": "**Abstract:** The chemical transformation of aromatic amino acids has emerged as an attractive alternative to non-selective lysine or cysteine labeling for the modification of biomolecules. However, this strategy has largely been limited by the scope of functional groups and biocompatible reaction conditions available. Herein, we report the implementation of near-infrared-activatable photocatalysts, TITMAPP and \\({}^{n}\\)-Pr-DMQA\\({}^{\\ast}\\), capable of generating fluoroalkyl radicals for selective tryptophan functionalization within simple and complex biological systems. At the peptide level, a diverse set of iodo-perfluoroalkyl reagents were used to install biorthogonal handles for downstream applications or link inter- or intramolecular tryptophan residues for peptide stapling. We also found this photoredox transformation amenable to biotinylation of intracellular proteins in live cells for downstream confocal imaging and mass spectrometry-based analysis. Given the inherent tissue penetrant nature of near-infrared light we further demonstrated the utility of this technology to achieve photocatalytic protein fluoroalkylation in physiologically relevant tissue and tumor environments. **Introduction** Advancement of technologies that allow efficient chemical modification of proteins in physiologically relevant systems for the characterization of protein function, localization, and dynamics remains an important challenge in chemical biology\\({}^{1-6}\\). This is mainly due to the stringent requirements within complex biological systems that preclude the use of manychemical protein labeling methods. Thus, while several strategies have been developed that permit the direct functionalization of peptides and proteins outside of their native environments[7, 8, 9, 10, 11], chemical transformation methods that are suitable for labeling of proteins in live cells and tissues remain limited. Historically, the strategy for protein labeling relies on highly abundant and solvent exposed nucleophilic residues such as lysine and cysteine. However, these methods can suffer from the inability to conjugate in a regioselective manner and, in the case of cysteines, require the need for structural disruptions via reductive treatment. To this end, targeting aromatic residues such as tyrosine[12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18], tryptophan[19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27], and histidine[28, 29, 30] have become an attractive protein labeling strategy (Figure 1a). In addition to direct protein labeling, functionalization of these residues can be leveraged for novel peptide modification strategies. In particular, this can have important implications in the development of novel peptide macrocyclization and stapling techniques, whereby two or more sidechains are cross-linked to generate new topological architectures valuable to the medicinal chemistry community[31, 32, 33, 34, 35]. Although fluorine is essentially absent from biology, incorporation of fluoroalkyl groups has been shown to enhance structural stability of peptides and proteins and improve physical properties of protein-based materials[36]. This has recently inspired new tryptophan transformations that includes the direct installation of trifluoromethyl groups within short peptides[37], native protein constructs for 19F NMR analysis[38] and 18F labeled peptides for positron emission tomography (PET) studies[39] using sodium trifluormethanesulfinate under oxidative conditions. In a similar approach, Beier and colleagues utilized a limited scope of fluoroalkylated cyclic hypervalent iodine scaffolds for fluoroalkylation of peptides[40] and proteins[41]. Despite these early demonstrations, the establishment of general and biocompatible strategies that can accommodate a wide range of functional groups on the fluoroalkyl radical is lacking. Moreover, direct fluoroalkylation to bridge tryptophan residues would enable access to novel stapled peptides and in principle provide an ideal approach for labeling proteins in live cells and complex tissue environments. Over the last decade, photoredx catalysis platforms have had a tremendous impact for activating unreactive functional groups to achieve otherwise challenging transformations. Since many common biomolecules are inert and weakly absorb in the visible light region, this mode of activation has undoubtedly become an attractive biocompatible strategy for labeling[42]. Given the intrinsic value of protein labeling methods for studying biological systems in the context of their physiological environments, tissue penetrant low-energy near-infrared (NIR) light based photoactivable technologies that allow control of catalytic activity for bioconjugation are in high demand. To address this need, we envisaged a photocatalyst that will absorb in the NIR range (\\(\\lambda>600\\) nm) to generate a fluoroalkyl radical under mild conditions to achieve peptide functionalization, protein bioconjugation, and live cell and tissue labeling (Figure 1b and 1c). Along these lines, Rovis and colleagues recently introduced a series of NIR-based Os(II) photocatalysts for a wide range of catalytic reactions[43]. Other NIR-mediated photocatalytic transformations efforts include the use of organic photocatalysts such as methylene blue[44, 45, 46], helical carbenium ion[46] (a known bioimaging agent in live cells)[47], and commonly used photodynamic therapy reagents porphyrin[48] and phthalocyanine photosensizers[49]. Notably, Postigo and colleagues demonstrated the generation of fluoroalkyl radicals from perfluoroalkyl iodides via a phthalocyanine zinc photosensitizer for C-H functionalization of heteroarenes[49]. However, despite this early progress, no NIR light-based method exists to date that is capable of spanning the spectrum from peptide functionalization to protein labeling in live cell and tissue environments. In this manuscript, we disclose the development of a NIR photoredox technology for fluoroalkylation of tryptophan residues to not only access new stapled peptides but also label within cellular and tissue environments for downstream confocal imaging and mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. ## Results and Discussion Inspired by these recent reports, we began our investigation with the evaluation of a series of known and commercially available NIR-based photoredox catalysts with a key design element in mind requiring catalyst hydrophilicity for biocompatible conditions. Following an extensive optimization campaign, we found that tryptophan containing peptide substrates underwent efficient C-H fluoroalkylation at room temperature in the presence of water soluble 5,10,15,20-Tetrakis(4-trimethylammoniumophenyl)porphyrin tetra(p-toluenesulfonate) (TTMAPP, **1**, 1 mol %) or helical carbenium ion, \\(N^{\\prime}\\)-di-\\(n\\)-propyl-1,13-dimethoxyquinacridinium tetrafluoroborate (\\({}^{\\circ}\\)-Pr-DMQA\\({}^{\\ast}\\), **2**, 2.5 mol %) photocatalysts to afford the desired product with excellent conversion (Figure 1d, Table S1) after NIR light irradiation (660 nm) in a biophotoreactor. As previously reported by Postigo[49] the use of colliding and ascorbic acid was found to be crucial for porphyrin catalysts and detrimental in the case of helical carbenium ion catalysts. Finally, control reactions in the absence of either photocatalyst or light resulted in no product formation and quantitative recovery of the starting material (Table S1). With the optimized conditions in hand, the scope of reactivity and compatibility on tryptophan containing peptides was examined (Table 1). Using this mild protocol with photocatalyst TTMAPP **1**, we achieved Trp-functionalization of simple to relatively complex peptides in moderate to excellent yields (Table 1, 9-18, 33-72% yield, Table S2). Similar yields were obtained when \\({}^{n}\\)-Pr-DMQA\\({}^{+}\\)**2** was used only with simple tryptophan substrates (Table 1, 9 & 12). An important feature of this technology to enable conjugation in any biological system Figure 1: Biocompatible near-infrared (NIR) light-activated fluoroalkylation of tryptophan residues. a) Aromatic amino acids have emerged as attractive targets for peptide functionalization and protein labeling. b) The generation of fluoroalkyl radicals via NIR light enables selective modification of tryptophan residues. c) This methodology may be applied to a diverse range of biological settings spanning from the peptide level to intracellular labeling within tissue. d) Summary survey of photocatalysts to identify optimal conditions for NIR-mediated tryptophan functionalization. would be the compatibility of different functionalized perfluoroalkyl components. Thus, we next focused on exploring various perfluoroalkyl iodide scaffolds (Table 1). To our delight, perfluoroalkyl substrates that include fluoroalkyl-substituted sulfone, phosphonate, and trifluoromethyl groups were well-tolerated to give desired products in good yields (Table 1, **19-23**, 22-74% yield, Table S2). More importantly, the photocatalytic fluoroalkylation protocol was also compatible with relevant biorthogonal alkynes and azides (Table 1, **24-25**, Table S2) opening up opportunities for further functionalization of the peptides via click chemistry. substrates with varied linker length as the limiting reagent, photocatalyst TIMAPP **1**, and a radical source to access rigid perfluoroalkyl peptide staples. Under these conditions, a broad range of linear and cyclic peptides (such as disulfide-bridged peptides) successfully undergo Trp-Trp dimerization to give desired products in good yields (Table 2, **26-30**, 29-52% yield). On the other hand, use of excess diiodo-perfluoroalkane allowed for installation of mono-functionalized products with the iodide-moiety (Table S3, 16-55% yield), providing synthetic handles for further derivatization. Based on these results, we next questioned whether this protocol could be used for intramolecular stapling of tryptophan residues. To this end, linear peptide sequences that contained tryptophan residues separated by **1**, 2, 3, or 4 amino acids were evaluated. As shown in Table 2, structurally diverse peptides can be successfully cyclized using this technology. Importantly, different perfluoro linker lengths and native or substituted peptide substrates containing wide-ranging amino acid residues can be cyclized readily under the NIR photocatalytic conditions (**31-34**, 13-25% yield). To the best of our knowledge, this stapling strategy represents the first synthetic platform to access these new peptide architectures. Having showcased the ability of this methodology to functionalize and staple peptides, we next explored the feasibility of these NIR photocatalysts for tryptophan-based protein labeling. We first evaluated photocatalytic stability of TTMAPP or \\({}^{n}\\)-Pr-DMQA\\({}^{+}\\) in the presence of NIR light, PBS buffer, and a newly synthesized biotin-containing iodoperfluoroalkyl reagent (**35**) through UV-Vis analysis and observed a robust catalytic process (Figure S1). Next, proteins of varying sizes including carbonic anhydrase, albumin, phosphorylase B, and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were selected as model substrates for protein bioconjugation (Figure 2 and Figure S2). For these labeling reactions, each protein was combined with TTMAPP or \\({}^{n}\\)-Pr-DMQA\\({}^{+}\\) and **35** in aqueous buffer (PBS) to induce protein fluoroalkylation via NIR light irradiation at various time points. The resulting protein biotinylation events were then visualized by western blot. TTMAPP (Figure 2b) and \\({}^{n}\\)-Pr-DMQA\\({}^{+}\\) (Figure 2c) yielded similar protein biotinylation patterns in a time-dependent fashion. Notably, protein labeling only occurred with NIR light irradiation and photocatalyst with minimal background biotinylation observed in no light controls. To investigate sites of labeling, peptide-based LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on labeled protein revealing a high propensity for covalent attachment to tryptophan residues, as expected, as well as other electron rich-amino acids (Figures 2b and 2c and Table S4) showcasing the versatility of this methodology for protein labeling in physiologically relevant conditions. The ability of these methods to label proteins under biocompatible conditions led us to next investigate the utility of this NIR-activatable chemistry within the context of live cells. For this, we subjected the colorectal carcinoma cell line, HT-29, to a NIR light labeling time course in the presence of biotin probe [35], ascorbic acid (in the case of TTMAPP) and TTMAPP or \\({}^{n}\\)-Pr Figure 2: (a) Protein labeling with catalyst (TTMAPP or \\({}^{n}\\)-Pr-DMQA\\({}^{*}\\)). (b, c) Carbonic anhydrase (30 kDa), albumin (44 kDa), phosphorylase B (97 kDa), or bovine serum albumin (BSA, 66 kDa) were biotinylated with TTMAPP and ascorbic acid (b) or \\({}^{n}\\)-Pr-DMQA\\({}^{*}\\) (c) and **35** under NIR light irradiation. Protein labeling was visualized by western blot using streptavidin dye (left). LC-MS/MS peptide mapping confirmed the modification of tryptophan residues on proteins, including surface-exposed W268 and W149 on albumin (right). DMQA\\({}^{+}\\) photocatalyst (Figure 3a). Photocatalyst- and time-dependent protein biotinylation was observed by flow cytometry (Figure 3b) showcasing the ability of this technology to label proteins on live cells. To investigate how these labeling conditions impacted cell viability following photoactivation, we performed an irradiation time course in the presence or absence of biotin probe [(35)] and ascorbic acid (in the case of TTMAPP) and observed that increased irradiation time and absence of additives led to decreased cell viability for both the TTMAPP and \\({}^{n}\\)-Pr-DMQA\\({}^{+}\\) labeling methods (Figure 3c and Figure S3). Confocal imaging-based analysis of HT-29 cells labeled using \\({}^{n}\\)-Pr-DMQA\\({}^{+}\\) revealed photocatalyst- and light irradiation-dependent biotinylation compared to minimal to no biotinylation in the absence of light or \\({}^{n}\\)-Pr-DMQA\\({}^{+}\\) (Figure 3d). In contrast, minimal detection of HT-29 cell staining was observed in TTMAPP labeling reactions, likely due to oxidation events that impede cell staining (Figure 3d). Finally, we found this labeling approach suitable for targeted antibody-mediated proximity biotinylation on the cell surface as demonstrated through use of primary antibody (\\(\\alpha\\)-CD45-\\({}^{n}\\)-Pr-DMQA\\({}^{+}\\)) or two-antibody (\\(\\alpha\\)-CD45/Secondary antibody-\\({}^{n}\\)-Pr-DMQA\\({}^{+}\\)) targeting systems (Figure S4). We further explored labeled cellular environments using LC/MS-MS-based proteomic analysis. Accordingly, several cancer cell lines were selected that originated from a diverse set of tissue types that included HT29 and SW837 (colon), NCI-H2126 (lung), and HPAC (pancreas). To induce cellular labeling, cells were incubated with TTMAPP, biotin probe (**36**), and ascorbic acid (500 \\(\\upmu\\)M) for 30 minutes and then irradiated for 30 minutes to induce biotinylation. Cells were lysed and biotinylated proteins were enriched using streptavidin beads and subjected to downstream TMT-based proteomic workflows for identification and quantification via LC/MS Figure 3: a) Cellular labeling with catalyst (TTMAPP and \\({}^{n}\\)-Pr-DMQA\\({}^{+}\\)) for imaging and proteomic applications. b) HT-29 cells were incubated with free TTMAPP and ascorbic acid (left panel) or free \\({}^{n}\\)-Pr-DMQA\\({}^{+}\\) (right panel), the iodo-fluoro biotin probe (**35**) and irradiated under NIR light for the indicated time points.

Significant protein enrichment was observed across all tested cell lines compared to no light controls (Figures S5 and S6). Gene ontology (GO)[50] analyses of these significantly enriched proteins revealed an overrepresentation of (m)RNA processing and splicing biological processes in three of the four cell lines (SW837, NCI-H2126, and HPAC) (Figure S5). The labeling of (m)RNA binding proteins by TTMAPP can likely be explained based on previous observations that cationic porphyrins interact with and disrupt nucleic acid-based G quadruplex secondary structures[51, 52, 53]. The successful photocatalytic-driven fluoroalkylation achieved in live cells highlights the ability of this approach to label within different cellular compartments. The use of NIR light offers potential for bioconjugation or labeling in complex biological samples that require penetrance of the activating light source. To demonstrate the utility of NIR-mediated chemistry we performed biotinylation of proteins in primary tissues.

Confocal microscopy of colon slices shows biotinylation of proteins when using either TTMAPP or \"-Pr-DMQA\" mediated labeling (Figure 4b). Whole tissue samples were further processed for LC-MS/MS-based analysis to explore differences between normal and diseased tissues. Through this analysis, we observed that while the overall extent of protein labeling was comparable within healthy and diseased tissue (as evident by the number of significantly enriched proteins), the subcellular localization of enriched proteins was notably different (Figures 4c and 4d and Figures S7 and S8). GO[50] analyses of significantly enriched proteins within healthy brain and esophageal tissue revealed an overrepresentation of mitochondrial localizing proteins while enriched proteins in tumor brain and esophageal tissue displayed more non-specific subcellular localization (Figure 4d and FigureS7).

This chemistry was well tolerated and directly adaptable for both intracellular and targeted cell surface labeling on live cells. Furthermore, the longer wavelength requirement of this technology enabled protein labeling within patient-derived tissues that was combined with downstream confocal imaging and proteomic analysis to profile unique differences between normal and tumor samples.

            "input_text": "###### Abstract To obtain accurate enthalpies of formation of a chemical species, \\(\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{f}}\\), one needs a procedure to quantitatively connect the results from quantum mechanical (QM) calculations with the experimental enthalpies of elements in their standard state, often along with additional empirical corrections. Although QM methods continue to improve, accuracy gains from new methods are usually realized if the calculations for\\(\\Delta H_{\\rm f}\\) are properly corrected. One such approach is to use atomization energy corrections (AECs) followed by bond additivity corrections (BACs), such as those defined by Petersson et al. or Anantharaman and Melius. Another approach is to utilize isodesemic reactions (IDRs) which are error-canceling reactions that can be constructed systematically as shown by Buerger et al. In this work, we implement all of these approaches in Arkane, an open-source software that can calculate species thermochemistry from computations done by a wide variety of QM software packages. As part of this work, we curate a diverse database of over 400 reference species from the available literature for use in fitting BACs or to participate in IDRs, and also provide AECs and BACs for 15 commonly used levels of theory using the workflow implemented. When comparing the approaches, we find that both BAC types yield results of similar accuracy, though the Anantharaman and Melius-type BACs seem to generalize better. Further, although the IDRs approach is often as accurate as the BAC approaches and sometimes even more advantageous, we find that this method appears to be less robust than the BAC methods. In particular, the accuracy of the IDRs approach is sensitive to the chosen reference species and reactions. Therefore, in addition to providing the automated AECs and BACs fitting procedure, we also propose improved methods to select IDRs. ## 1 Introduction Obtaining high-accuracy chemical species thermochemistry is essential to solve many important problems in chemistry. Experiments can provide high-accuracy results, often yielding data accuracy within 0.1 kcal/mol or better. However, usually several experiments need to be combined to obtain accurate thermochemical parameters reported in standard states. Moreover, many species (especially radicals, but not exclusively) cannot be isolated conveniently for experimentation. Due to the importance of these parameters, several databases exist that provide high-accuracy thermochemistry data. One widely used database is the Active Thermochemical Table (ATcT)[1, 2], which aims to produce a self-consistent set of species thermochemistry with continually improving accuracy. When data from ATcT or other high-quality experimental sources are available, they represent the preferred route for obtaining the most accurate thermochemical values of a species of interest. However, entries in ATcT represent only a minuscule fraction of all species of interest in the vast chemical universe. Given that experiments are often time-consuming, particularly if they require synthesizing the species of interest, computing species thermochemistry through quantum mechanical (QM) calculations can prove quite valuable. As QM methods continue to improve, higher accuracy data can be obtained for larger and larger species. For example, the domain-based local pairwise natural orbital (DLPNO) coupled cluster (CC) methods [3, 4] promise to deliver CC accuracy of less than 1 kcal/mol for molecules much larger than what has previously been feasible with classical CC methods. However, to realize the accuracy gains, it is well-known that energy corrections are needed in addition to the QM calculations to reduce residual errors present from the given level of theory (LOT). Usually, atomization energy corrections (AECs) are needed to correct for the large systematic errors in the computed absolute energies of atoms, and to connect the computed zero of energy to the standard state zero of energy used when defining the enthalpy of formation (a.k.a. heats of formation) \\(\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{f}}\\). As we show later in this work, if no additional corrections are used, the resulting \\(\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{f}}\\) tends to have a fairly wide distribution of errors, often not centered around zero. The need for additional corrections is well-known, and in fact, such corrections have already been derived for some DLPNO methods [5]. There are several approaches to achieve quantum thermochemistry corrections beyond the AEC. Recently, delta machine learning (\\(\\Delta\\)-ML) techniques have been applied to this type of problem [6]. However, while ML methods have gained popularity, they often lack the interpretability intrinsic to classic strategies. In this study, our emphasis will be placed on two conventional methods. The first approach involves the use of bond additivity corrections (BACs). BAC methods assume that the residual error from QM calculations can be attributed to errors associated with specific types of bonds within a molecule. Further, the errors associated with a particular type of bond (e.g., a C-C single bond) are assumed to be largely consistent across various molecules that contain the same bond type. Therefore, a correction value can be fitted for each bond type found in a collection of reference molecules, and the total bond additivity correction is simply the sum of these corrections for every bond in a species of interest. In this work, we focus on two popular implementations of BAC: those of Petersson et al. [7] and those of Anantharaman and Melius [8]. For brevity, below we call the Anantharaman & Melius' BAC's \"Melius-type\" or \"m-BAC\", although we note that Melius had success with several different types of BACs during his long career [9]. Similarly, we will denote Petersson's BAC as \"Petersson-type\" or \"p-BAC\". A separate approach involves the use of isodesmic reactions (IDRs) [10, 11], where species participating in the reaction other than the species of interest, or the target species, are calculated at the same LOT but also have precisely known (e.g., experimental) enthalpies of formation. The IDRs approach has the advantage of being insensitive to the AECs since they cancel out when computing heats of reaction. The IDRs approach has been used to calculate accurate enthalpy of formation for large molecules such as C\\({}_{60}\\) and corannulene [12]. Recent breakthroughs have been made in this avenue, with the work of Buerger et al. [13] showing how isodesmic reactions can be found systematically and automatically rather than designing them by hand as has been done traditionally. This advancement allows IDRs to be used in high-throughput calculations when implemented in statistical mechanics or thermochemistry software. One problem we have often encountered in practice is that the choice of reference species (a.k.a. the training set) used in the above-mentioned thermo-correction approaches can vary from study to study. This training set inconsistency can cause issues when BACs fitted to a small set of reference molecules are used for species that are not well represented by the original set (e.g., using BACs fitted to only neutral, closed-shell species for charged or open-shell species). The exact species set used in the fitting process is not always reported in literature, making it difficult to reproduce some previous work. Therefore, in our implementation of the classical thermo-correction methods for comparison, we concurrently address the training set issue by providing a curated, open-source reference species database. In this work, we compute appropriate thermo-correction values and implement the calculation procedures for both p-type and m-type BAC approaches, along with IDRs approaches into the open-source statistical mechanics, kinetics, and thermochemistry software Arkane [14]. We also provide a curated database of reference species from the literature for fitting additional BAC values and for use in IDRs. We compare the thermo-correction approaches and also develop scripts for simplifying the process of adding new BACs for additional LOTs into Arkane. Finally, we provide new BAC values for 15 commonly used LOTs calculated using the workflow described here. ## 2 Theoretical Methods ### Reference Data Enthalpy of formation data at 298 K for 421 chemical species are compiled from the available literature, including the Active Thermochemical Tables (ATcT) [15, 2, 1], National Institute of Standards and Technology Chemistry WebBook (NIST) [16], the Computer Analysis of Thermo Chemical data (CATCH) search and retrieval system of Pedley et al. [17], Third Millennium Ideal Gas and Condensed Phase Thermochemical Database (3rd Mil.) [18], the NIST Computational Chemistry Comparison and Benchmark Database (CCCBDB) [19], and the works from Cioslowski et al. [20] and Benson [21]. The selected species exhibit a wide variety of chemical features, including a diversity of elements, charges, and multiplicities, as summarized in Table 1. Most species are small molecules, and about 100 species have five or more heavy atoms, with the largest species being adamantane (C\\({}_{10}\\)H\\({}_{16}\\)). In addition to encompassing a diverse range of chemical features, the species chosen all have very precisely known heats of formation. All species have an uncertainty (95% confidence interval based on ATcT) of 1 kJ/mol (0.3 kcal/mol) or less, with the exception of a few sulfur containing species. The average uncertainty is 0.63 kJ/mol (0.15 kcal/mol), and the largest uncertainty is 2.3 kJ/mol (0.55 kcal/mol) for tetramethylthiourea, a larger sulfur containing species. Therefore, by convention, all the species have gold-standard (uncertainty < 1 kcal/mol) thermochemistry. The data is compiled into a database of reference species (henceforth referred to as the \"reference database\") located within the larger RMG-database [22], available on GitHub (link provided in SI). The reference database consists of YAML text files, one for each species, that contains information about the species structure (e.g., 3D coordinates and RMG adjacency list representation of the species) along with the heat of formation data from the literature. Some species have data from multiple sources, which are all included in the database, but by default the source with the lowest uncertainty is used for computations. In addition to reference data derived from experiments, each YAML file stores calculated heats of formation (298 K, including calculated AECs) for various levels of theory, including those discussed in this work, with the plan of extending to additional LOTs in a subsequent publication. In this way, the YAML files contain enough information to fit and re-fit bond additivity corrections or to perform isodesmic reaction calculations using any of the species in the reference database. \\begin{table} \\begin{tabular}{l r r} \\hline Property & Number of Species & Percent of Species [\\%] \\\\ \\hline Contains H & 350 & 83.1 \\\\ Contains C & 356 & 84.6 \\\\ Contains N & 98 & 23.2 \\\\ Contains O & 169 & 40.1 \\\\ Contains F & 39 & 9.3 \\\\ Contains S & 72 & 17.1 \\\\ Contains Cl & 42 & 10.0 \\\\ Contains Br & 15 & 3.6 \\\\ Anions & 24 & 5.7 \\\\ Cations & 11 & 2.6 \\\\ Zwitterions & 17 & 4.0 \\\\ Open-shell & 73 & 17.3 \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular} \\end{table} Table 1: Properties of Reference Species (N = 421)The YAML format is chosen as a way to store the data in a human-readable and writable manner while also allowing the data to be read in as native RMG objects in Python. Adding data to these files therefore can also be done using the RMG and Arkane API, which contains useful functions for common tasks such as adding in data from quantum chemistry calculations for a new level of theory. ### Quantum Chemistry Calculations While there are many affordable quantum chemistry methods that can be used to calculate thermochemistry for large molecules, this work focuses on a subset of popular methods that span different levels of theory. In particular, we consider \\(\\omega\\)B97M-V [23], \\(\\omega\\)B97X-D [24], B3LYP-D3 [25], BP86 [26, 27], B97D3 [28], TPSS [29], PBE0 [30], M06-2X [31], CAM-B3LYP [32], B2PLYPD [33], G4 [34], and CBS-QB3 [35]. Additionally, the domain-based local pairwise natural orbital (DLPNO) coupled cluster methods are considered, specifically DLPNO-CCSD(T) [3] and DLPNO-CCSD(T)-F12 [4]. These methods are an approximation on traditional coupled cluster calculations that allow for a near-linear scaling in the coupled cluster iterations with minimal loss of accuracy. DLPNO methods promise to extend the gold standard chemical accuracy of coupled cluster methods to much larger molecules, as traditional coupled cluster methods usually become prohibitively expensive for even moderately sized molecules. \\(\\omega\\)B97M-V calculations are performed using QChem 5.2 [36] with the default grid and an SCF convergence tolerance of \\(10^{-8}\\). Calculations for composite methods and other DFTs are performed using Gaussian 16 [37] with tight settings for optimization and SCF convergence, along with an ultrafine grid. For B3LYP-D3 and B97D3, the empirical D3BJ [38] dispersion model in Gaussian is employed. Orca 4.2.1 [39, 40] is used for calculating single point energies with DLPNO-CCSD(T) and DLPNO-CCSD(T)-F12. Optimized geometries from \\(\\omega\\)B97X-D and \\(\\omega\\)B97M-V are used for DLPNO-CCSD(T) and DLPNO-CCSD(T)-F12, respectively. In all cases, a tightSCF convergence along with tightPNO tolerances for DLPNO approximations are used. For DLPNO-CCSD(T), def2-TZVP is used as the basis set with a def2TZVP/c auxillary basis set. For DLPNO-CCSD(T)-F12, cc-pVTZ-F12 is used as the basis set with an aug-cc-pVTZ/c auxillary basis sets and a cc-pVTZ-F12-CABS complimentary auxillary basis set. Additional DLPNO-CCSD(T)-F12 calculatons are performed",

Despite advancements in QM methods, improvements in accuracy often require additional corrections, such as atomization energy corrections (AECs) and bond additivity corrections (BACs). Two popular approaches are discussed: using BACs, either based on the work of Petersson et al. or Anantharaman and Melius, and isodesmic reactions (IDRs), which involve reactions involving known enthalpies.\n\nIn this study, an AI-assisted software, Arkane, is developed to handle these calculations. It incorporates various QM software packages, enabling species thermochemistry calculations. The researchers compile a comprehensive database of over 400 reference species from the literature, with precise enthalpy of formation values, to facilitate fitting BACs and constructing IDRs. They provide AECs and BACs for 15 commonly used levels of theory, ensuring consistency across calculations.\n\nWhen comparing BACs, both types yield comparable accuracy, with Anantharaman and Melius' BACs generally generalizing better. However, the IDR approach, despite its potential accuracy, is found to be less robust and sensitive to the choice of reference species and reactions. To address this, the study proposes improved methods for selecting suitable IDRs.\n\nThe reference database, curated within the RMG-database, is designed in YAML format to ensure readability and compatibility with Arkane. It includes species structures and calculated heats of formation, allowing for easy fitting and reuse of BACs or for isodesmic reaction calculations. The quantum chemistry calculations are carried out using various methods, such as ωB97M-V, ωB97X-D, and DLPNO-CCSD(T), among others, with strict convergence criteria to minimize errors.\n\nOverall, this research aims to provide a reliable and automated framework for calculating accurate species thermodynamics, combining the benefits of AECs, BACs, and IDRs in an open-source software like Arkane. By doing so, it contributes to the ongoing effort to enhance chemical thermochemistry data, especially for species that are challenging to experimentally measure."

The full list of methods used is presented in Table 2. ### Statistical Mechanics Calculations Heats of formation are calculated from single point energies and scaled[41] vibrational frequencies via Arkane[14] using the rigid rotor harmonic oscillator (RRHO) approximation. While the details of performing these calculations are well covered in the literature (we direct the interested reader to the Gaussian thermochemistry white paper[42] for a thorough introduction), we will cover some of the details here to shed some light on particular decisions made that affect how we define terms like atomization energy corrections. To calculate heats of formation, some care is needed, for it usually requires a thermody \\begin{table} \\begin{tabular}{l l} \\hline Label & Level of Theory \\\\ \\hline A & \\(\\omega\\)B97M-V/def2-TZVPD \\\\ B & B3LYP-D3BJ/def2-TZVP \\\\ C & \\(\\omega\\)B97X-D/def2-TZVP \\\\ D & DLPNO-CCSD(T)/def2-TZVP // \\(\\omega\\)B97X-D/def2-TZVP \\\\ E & DLPNO-CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVDZ-F12 // \\(\\omega\\)B97M-V/def2-TZVPD \\\\ F & DLPNO-CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 // \\(\\omega\\)B97M-V/def2-TZVPD \\\\ G & BP86/def2-TZVP \\\\ H & B97D3/def2-TZVP \\\\ I & TPSS/def2-TZVP \\\\ J & PBE0/def2-TZVP \\\\ K & M06-2X/def2-TZVP \\\\ L & CAM-B3LYP/def2-TZVP \\\\ M & B2PLYPD/def2-TZVP \\\\ N & G4 \\\\ O & CBS-QB3 \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular} \\end{table} Table 2: Levels of theory used in this work namic cycle (Figure 1) and the mixed-use of values from experiments and QM calculations that usually have different zero of energy references. For a given molecule, \"\\(M\\)\", the heat of formation at 298 K, \\(\\Delta H_{\\text{f}}(M,298\\,\\text{K})\\), is defined as the difference in enthalpy between the molecule and its constituents elements in their standard state. Using CH\\({}_{4}\\) as an example: \\[\\Delta H_{\\text{f}}(M:=\\text{CH}_{4},298\\,\\text{K})=H_{\\text{f}}(\\text{CH}_{4}, 298\\,\\text{K})-H_{\\text{f}}(\\text{C},\\text{graphite},298\\,\\text{K})-2H_{\\text{ f}}(\\text{H}_{2},298\\,\\text{K}) \\tag{1}\\] However, single point energies obtained from QM calculation usually have charges separated at infinity and T = 0 K as the zero of energy. Figure 1 shows how this difference in the zero of energy can be resolved to calculate the desired heats of formation \\(\\Delta H_{\\text{f}}(M,298\\,\\text{K})\\). To emphasize the conceptual meaning for each leg of the cycle, we have left out stoichiometric coefficients that serve to balance the number of each type of element for each step to avoid cluttering the figure. On the left-hand side of Figure 1, we have the desired quantity, \\(\\Delta H_{\\text{f}}(M,298\\,\\text{K})\\), and on the bottom right corner, we have the above-mentioned QM zero of energy. The corrections for Figure 1: Conceptual diagram outlining the thermodynamic cycle to calculate \\(\\Delta H_{\\text{f}}(M,298K)\\) from values that can be computed via quantum chemistry or are known experimentally. \\(\\Delta H_{\\text{f}}(M,298K)\\) can be further corrected by applying BACs or IDRs. temperature effects on enthalpies are simply related by heat capacitiy integrals, and the complexity lies on the calculation of \\(\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{f}}(M,0\\,\\mathrm{K})\\) from QM results. Applying Equation 1 for 0 K reveals that the needed quantities are \\(H_{\\mathrm{f}}(\\mathrm{CH}_{4},0\\,\\mathrm{K})\\), \\(H_{\\mathrm{f}}(\\mathrm{C},\\mathrm{graphite},0\\,\\mathrm{K})\\), and \\(H_{\\mathrm{f}}(\\mathrm{H}_{2},0\\,\\mathrm{K})\\). At 0 K, \\(H_{\\mathrm{f}}(\\mathrm{CH}_{4},0\\,\\mathrm{K})\\) is equal to the change in internal energy of the methane molecule (\\(M:=\\mathrm{CH}_{4}\\)) from charges separated at infinity, and this can be calculated as the sum of its single point energy (\\(E_{SP}^{M}\\)) and zero point energy (\\(E_{ZPE}^{M}\\)) from QM. To calculate \\(H_{\\mathrm{f}}(\\mathrm{C},\\mathrm{graphite},0\\,\\mathrm{K})\\), we need the enthalpy corrections between elements in their reference state (ES) and isolated atoms (\\(A\\)), i.e., \\(\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{f}}(A:=\\mathrm{C},0\\,\\mathrm{K})=H_{\\mathrm{f}}(\\mathrm{C}, \\mathrm{isolated\\ atom},0\\,\\mathrm{K})-H_{\\mathrm{f}}(\\mathrm{C},\\mathrm{ graphite},0\\,\\mathrm{K})\\). These corrections are usually obtained from experiments and very accurate QM calculations, and their values are well-tabulated with high accuracy.[43] In addition, we need to add the AEC that relates the single point energy of isolated atoms to the QM zero of energy for a chosen level of theory, where AEC is applied to each atom in a molecule. Although we take \\(H_{\\mathrm{f}}(\\mathrm{C},\\mathrm{graphite},0\\,\\mathrm{K})\\) as an example, the calculation of \\(H_{\\mathrm{f}}(\\mathrm{H}_{2},0\\,\\mathrm{K})\\) follows the same logic. Combining all the pieces, we can show that for a generic molecule \\(M\\): \\[\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{f}}(M,0\\,\\mathrm{K})=(E_{SP}^{M}+E_{ZPE}^{M})-\\sum_{A\\in M} \\left[AEC-\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{f}}(A,0\\,\\mathrm{K})\\right] \\tag{2}\\] The remaining temperature difference can be accounted by the difference in heat capacities between the elemental states and the molecule from 0 to 298 K: \\[\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{f}}(M,298\\,\\mathrm{K})=\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{f}}(M,0\\,\\mathrm{K} )+\\int_{0}^{298}C_{p}^{M}(T)dT-\\int_{0}^{298}C_{p}^{ES}(T)dT \\tag{3}\\] We use the experimental heat capacities of the reference elements, and our computed RRHO heat capacities for the molecules. With this, all legs of the cycle are either known experimental quantities or can be calculated from the quantum chemistry output file. #### Atomization Energy Corrections Importantly, because the single point energies of isolated atoms from QM calculations often carry substantial and different systematic errors associated with the chosen level of theory, we use fitted AECs for each LOT as a replacement of direct QM calculations for isolated atoms, for we find the AEC approach to be more consistent. In this work, fitting AECs involved a linear least-squares fitting (see equations in SI) to minimize the error in calculating \\(\\Delta H_{\\text{f}}(M,298\\,\\text{K})\\) for a small subset of molecules ranging across all elements: H\\({}_{2}\\), N\\({}_{2}\\), O\\({}_{2}\\), S\\({}_{2}\\), F\\({}_{2}\\), Cl\\({}_{2}\\), Br\\({}_{2}\\), HF, HCl, HBr, H\\({}_{2}\\)S, H\\({}_{2}\\)O, CH\\({}_{4}\\), NH\\({}_{3}\\), ClCH\\({}_{3}\\), and methyl radical. These species are chosen because they have precisely known heats of formation (or by definition exactly known) and are small enough such that the risk of additional errors in calculating any of these species at any LOT is low (e.g., no risk of converging to the wrong conformer). To further minimize errors from the chosen level of theory, experimental geometries and frequencies are used for this fitting. Using these AECs and the procedure shown in Figure 1 allows for calculating \\(\\Delta H_{\\text{f}}(M,298\\,\\text{K})\\) for molecules at the given level of theory with semi-reasonable accuracy. However, significant residual error usually remains if no further corrections, such as bond additivity corrections, are applied. ### Bond Additivity Corrections In this work we consider two different types of bond additivity corrections: BACs similar to those used by Petersson et al. [7] (\"Petersson-type\" or \"p-BAC\"), and those used by Anantharaman and Melius [8] (\"Melius-type\" or \"m-BAC\"). In both cases, BAC values are applied per bond as a correction to \\(\\Delta H_{\\text{f}}(M,298\\,\\text{K})\\) with only AECs applied. The BAC parameters are calculated for the 15 LOT examined in the work by fitting to all reference species in the database to minimize errors between the BAC-corrected \\(\\Delta H_{\\text{f}}(M,298\\,\\text{K})\\) and the known experimental values. **Petersson-Type BACs** Petersson-type BACs assign a single corrective value for every type of bond present in the 2D representation of the molecule. These bond types are defined pairwise for every combination of elements, including all integer bond orders. For example, common bond types include the carbon-carbon single bond (C-C), the carbon-carbon double bond (C=C), and the carbon-hydrogen bond (C-H). Applying Petersson-type BACs then is just a matter of adding the corresponding corrective value to \\(\\Delta H_{\\text{f}}(M,298\\,\\text{K})\\) for every single instance of all types of bonds in the molecule. For example, Figure 2 shows the process of applying Petersson-type BACs to pyrrole. Note that because only integer bond orders are considered, this scheme considers pyrrole to be made up of 2 standard C=C bonds and 1 standard C-C bond, even though pyrrole is aromatic. The fact that Petersson-type BACs do not treat aromatic bonds differently nor consider the chemical environment around the bond is potentially a shortcoming, though this trade-off for the sake of simplicity does reduce the number of parameters needed. As an upper bound the number of parameters grows quadratically with the number of elements considered (the scaling is \\(3(N+1)\\frac{N}{2}\\), where \\(N\\) is the number of elements, and 3 comes from the number of typical bond types in a molecule i.e., single, double, and triple), though the number of parameters needed is less, as not all bond orders are valid between all pairs of Figure 2: Example application of Petersson-type BACs to a 2D representation of pyrrole for calculating thermo-corrections to \\(\\Delta H_{\\text{f}}(M,298\\,\\text{K})\\). The correction to the molecule is the sum of corrections to each bonds as illustrated. elements. ### Melius-Type BACs Anantharaman and Melius developed an alternative formulation for correcting \\(\\Delta H_{\\text{f}}(M,298\\,\\text{K})\\) that incorporates bond distances from the calculated 3D geometry of the molecule and considers information about neighboring atoms. Equation set (4) shows the details of calculating Melius-type BACs. We have adapted our own notation here to help emphasize and distinguish some parameters. For example, variables with subscripts (e.g., \\(\\alpha_{a}\\)) are fitted parameters (with one parameter per element per level of theory), while variables with superscripts (e.g., \\(S^{M}\\)) are properties of the atoms, bonds, or molecules such as spin and bond distances. \\(\\xi\\) is a fixed parameter of \\(3\\,\\text{\\AA}^{-1}\\) as recommended by Anantharaman and Melius. \\[\\text{BAC}(M)=\\sum_{a\\in M}\\text{Cor}^{\\text{atom}}(a)+\\sum_{b\\in M}\\text{Cor} ^{\\text{bond}}(b)+\\text{Cor}^{\\text{molecule}}(M) \\tag{4a}\\] \\[\\text{Cor}^{\\text{atom}}(a)=\\alpha_{a}\\] (4b) \\[\\text{Cor}^{\\text{bond}}(\\text{bond}(x,y))=\\sqrt{\\beta_{x}\\beta _{y}}\\cdot e^{-\\xi R^{xy}}+\\sum_{w\\in N(x)\\setminus y}[\\gamma_{w}+\\gamma_{x}]+ \\sum_{z\\in N(y)\\setminus z}[\\gamma_{z}+\\gamma_{y}]\\] (4c) \\[\\text{Cor}^{\\text{molecule}}(a)=K_{\\text{LOT}}\\cdot\\left(S^{M}- \\sum_{a\\in M}S^{a}\\right) \\tag{4d}\\] Equation (4a) shows that Melius-type BACs have three additive correction components for a given molecule \\(M\\): one for all of its atoms \\(a\\), one for all of its bonds \\(b\\), and one based on the molecule as a whole. The atom corrections, given by Equation (4b) apply a single corrective parameter (\\(\\alpha_{a}\\)) based on the element type for atom \\(a\\). Equation (4c) shows the correction applied to a single bond between atoms \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). The first term depends on the bond length, \\(R^{xy}\\), and fitted parameters \\(\\beta_{x}\\) and \\(\\beta_{y}\\) based on the element types of atoms \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). The next two terms in Equation (4c) consider contributions from neighboring atoms (i.e., atoms that are either bonded to \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) but excluding both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\)), with fitted parameterssuch as \\(\\gamma_{x}\\) based per element. Finally, Equation (4d) considers the spin of the molecule, \\(S^{M}\\) and the spins of the atoms \\(S^{a}\\), and includes a fitted parameter \\(K_{\\text{LOT}}\\) that only depends on the level of theory used. Given this, Melius-type BACs require fitting \\(3N+1\\) parameters for a given level of theory considering \\(N\\) elements. This is usually smaller than the number of parameters in Petersson-type BAC's. An additional advantage of the Melius-type BACs is that they do not require the bonds to be assigned integer bond-orders, so they are better for molecules with more than one plausible Lewis structure such as aromatics. Because Equation (4) is non-linear in its fitted parameters, a non-linear least-squares fitting is used to fit these parameters for every level of theory. To do this fitting, ten different randomly-generated initial values for the parameters are employed in each of 10 fits, and the best fit from these attempts is reported here. Each fit uses the least_squares function in scipy.optimize[44] with the Trust Region Reflective method,[45] a 3-point method for calculating the Jacobian, and default numerical convergence criteria. ### Isodesmic Reactions #### Background An alternative method to using AECs and BACs for calculating corrected heats of formation is to calculate heats of formation from constructed isodesmic reactions (hypothetical reactions where the number and type of each atom and bond are conserved). Just like using AECs and BACs, this approach also uses data from reference species to reduce the systematic errors from the quantum chemistry calculations at a given level of theory. Because the discussion below involves nuances among various types of enthalpies that can be quite confusing, we decide to adopt a new set of notations to assist understanding. Specifically, denote \\(\\Delta_{\\text{Y}}^{X}H_{\\text{Z}}^{\\circ}\\), where \\(X\\) denotes the source of data (\"qm\" for _ab initio_ calculation, \"ref\" for accurate reference values, \"bac\" for BAC-corrected values, \"aec\" for AEC-corrected values, \"iso\" for values corrected by isodesmic reaction approach), \\(Y\\) denotes the type of enthalpy (\"f\" for formation, \"rxn\" for reaction), \\(Z\\) denotes which species the enthalpy represents (\"\\(t\\)\" for target species, \"\\(i\\)\" for reference species in isodesmic reaction), and finally, \\(\\circ\\) denotes standard state at 298 K. For example, \\(\\Delta_{\\rm f}^{\\rm qm}H_{t}^{\\circ}\\) represents the heat of formation for target species at 298 K calculated from QM. In the isodesmic approach, a reaction is constructed containing the target species of interest (we take the convention that the target species is a reactant of the reaction) along with any number of reference species as additional reactants and/or products. Both the target (\\(t\\)) and the included reference species (\\(i\\)) have uncorrected heats of formation calculated at the same level of theory, \\(\\Delta_{\\rm f}^{\\rm qm}H_{t}^{\\circ}\\) and \\(\\Delta_{\\rm f}^{\\rm qm}H_{i}^{\\circ}\\), respectively. Additionally, reference species have well-known that heats of formation either from experimental data or high-accuracy quantum chemistry calculations, \\(\\Delta_{\\rm f}^{\\rm ref}H_{i}^{\\circ}\\). This is enough information to calculate a value for \\(\\Delta_{\\rm f}^{\\rm iso}H_{t}^{\\circ}\\), which is the heat of formation for the target species from isodesmic reactions that in a sense has been corrected much like \\(\\Delta_{\\rm f}^{\\rm bac}H_{t}^{\\circ}\\). The rationale for the isodesmic reaction approach is that while quantum chemistry calculations might have systematic errors in calculating heats of formation for a single species, these systematic errors will at least partly cancel when calculating heats of reactions, especially when",
            "output_text": "In this study, computational thermodynamics calculations are carried out using various levels of theory, as outlined in Table 2. The heats of formation for molecules are determined by accounting for differences in enthalpy between the molecule and its constituent elements in their standard states, taking into consideration the challenges posed by comparing energies from quantum mechanics (QM) calculations to experimental or theoretical reference points.\n\nSingle-point energies from QM calculations, which are typically referenced at zero Kelvin (0 K) and infinite separation, require adjustment to match the desired 298 K heats of formation. This is achieved through a thermodynamic cycle depicted in Figure 1, which involves a series of corrections. The heat of formation at 298 K (\\(\\Delta H_{\\text{f}}(M,298\\,\\text{K})\\)) is calculated by subtracting the energies of individual elements in their standard states from the molecule's energy, accounting for the difference in zero-energy references between the two.\n\nAtomization energy corrections (AECs) are applied to address the systematic errors in single-point energies for isolated atoms. These are derived from fitted parameters based on a small selection of molecules with well-characterized heats of formation and their reference geometries. The AECs, along with zero-point energies and thermal corrections, are combined to obtain the corrected enthalpy at 0 K.\n\nBond additivity corrections (BACs) are employed to further refine the heats of formation. Two types of BACs are considered: Petersson-type, which assigns a single correction for each bond type, and Melius-type, which utilizes bond distances and neighboring atom information. Both BACs are added to the AEC-corrected heats of formation to minimize discrepancies with experimental data.\n\nTo assess the reliability of the calculated heats of formation, isodesmic reactions are occasionally employed. This alternative method involves constructing hypothetical reactions that conserve the number and type of atoms and bonds, and uses reference species' enthalpies to cancel out systematic errors. By comparing the heats of formation for the target species calculated through QM with those from the isodesmic reactions, corrected values can be obtained.\n\nThe choice of method and the application of AECs, BACs, or isodesmic reactions depend on the specific requirements and the nature of the molecule being studied. The authors provide a comprehensive framework for these calculations, ensuring that the results are as accurate as possible within the limitations of the chosen theoretical approaches."

The assumption of this approach is then that for IDRs, the overall reaction enthalpy computed from individual species enthalpy in the reaction via high-level reference values or QM is approximately the same due to error cancellation, or \\(\\Delta_{\\rm rxn}^{\\rm ref}H^{\\circ}\\approx\\Delta_{\\rm rxn}^{\\rm qm}H^{\\circ}\\). Because reaction enthalpy can be calculated from individual species enthalpy in the reaction, we can rearrange this approximation to arrive at an equation for the target species, \\(\\Delta_{\\rm f}^{\\rm ref}H_{t}^{\\circ}\\), which is the unknown we want to compute. If the IDR assumption holds, then the calculated \\(\\Delta_{\\rm f}^{\\rm ref}H_{t}^{\\circ}\\) value should be relatively corrected against systematic errors. \\[\\Delta_{\\rm rxn}^{\\rm ref}H^{\\circ}=\\sum_{\\forall i\\in{\\rm rxn}}\\nu_{i} \\Delta_{\\rm f}^{\\rm ref}H_{i}^{\\circ} \\approx \\Delta_{\\rm rxn}^{\\rm qm}H^{\\circ}=\\sum_{\\forall i\\in{\\rm rxn}}\\nu_ {i}\\Delta_{\\rm f}^{\\rm qm}H_{i}^{\\circ} \\tag{5a}\\] \\[\\sum_{i\\setminus t}\\nu_{i}\\Delta_{\\rm f}^{\\rm ref}H_{i}^{\\circ}- \\Delta_{\\rm f}^{\\rm ref}H_{t}^{\\circ} \\approx \\sum_{i\\setminus t}\\nu_{i}\\Delta_{\\rm f}^{\\rm qm}H_{i}^{\\circ}- \\Delta_{\\rm f}^{\\rm qm}H_{t}^{\\circ}\\] (5b) \\[\\Delta_{\\rm f}^{\\rm ref}H_{t}^{\\circ} \\approx \\sum_{i\\setminus t}\\nu_{i}\\left[\\Delta_{\\rm f}^{\\rm ref}H_{i}^{ \\circ}-\\Delta_{\\rm f}^{\\rm qm}H_{i}^{\\circ}\\right]+\\Delta_{\\rm f}^{\\rm qm}H_{ t}^{\\circ}\\] (5c) \\[\\therefore\\Delta_{\\rm f}^{\\rm iso}H_{t}^{\\circ} \\equiv \\sum_{i\\setminus t}\\nu_{i}\\left[\\Delta_{\\rm f}^{\\rm ref}H_{i}^{ \\circ}-\\Delta_{\\rm f}^{\\rm qm}H_{i}^{\\circ}\\right]+\\Delta_{\\rm f}^{\\rm qm}H_{ t}^{\\circ} \\tag{5d}\\] Equation (5) shows the calculation scheme starting with the IDR assumption that errors somewhat cancel when calculating heats of reactions to arrive at a value for \\(\\Delta_{\\rm f}^{\\rm iso}H_{t}^{\\circ}\\). Equation (5a) starts with this main assumption, and Equation 5b simply separates out the target species from the remaining reference species of the isodesmic reaction. Equation (5c) rearranges this result to yield an approximate value for the unknown \\(\\Delta_{\\rm f}^{\\rm ref}H_{t}^{\\circ}\\), which Equation (5d) uses to define the calculation for \\(\\Delta_{\\rm f}^{\\rm iso}H_{t}^{\\circ}\\). A keen observer will note that the summation term in Equation (5d) can be viewed as the corrective term to the calculated heat of formation of the target species, and that this term serves a similar role to applying BACs. This connection in fact runs much deeper. Let us suppose that every species in the isodesmic reaction is composed of a set of definable atom and bond types (could be similar to the bond types of Petersson et al. or more complex), and that there is a systematic error from the quantum chemistry calculation associated with each of these atom and bond types. If the reaction under consideration was an isodesmic reaction with respect to these atom and bond types, then these systematic errors exactly cancel. However, since we have excluded the target species from the summation in Equation (5d), the atom and bond types present in the target molecule have not cancelled. In this way, the summation in Equation (5d) can be viewed as calculating corrections similar to AECs and BACs for the chemical features (e.g., atom type, bond type, rings, charge, multiplicity, etc.) present in the target molecule and then applying these corrections. Consequently, if someone constructs isodesmic reactions by considering the bond types of Petersson et al., then the IDR scheme is mathematically equivalent to applying Petersson-type BACs, albeit with a much smaller training set since usually only a few species are selected to build IDRs. Given this similarity, it is important to discuss the differences between BACs and IDRs that can affect their performance. As mentioned previously, isodesmic reactions essentially use a much smaller training set to apply what are essentially another form of BACs. One disadvantage is that if a reference species included in the isodesmic reaction has a large uncharacteristic error, this error will affect the final result much more than if a larger reference set was used for training. One way to mitigate this error sensitivity issue is to take an average or median of values obtained from multiple isodesmic reactions. Another method to allow better error cancellation is to choose species that are chemically similar to the target when building IDRs. Finally, constraints could be placed on the species of an isodesmic reaction to ensure that the bonds present in the reaction are similar in nature to each other, and thus should have similar cancellation of errors. These constraints have been employed in the literature, and we adapt them for our workflow. ### Isodesmic reaction classes and constraints As part of their work developing an implementation to apply isodesmic reactions for correcting thermochemistry calculations, Buerger et al. [13] defined four different classes of isodesmic reactions (labeled RC1 - RC4) of increasing rigor (more likely to result in better cancellation of errors). In this work, we only consider classes RC2-RC4, for RC1 by definition is only an \"error-canceling\" reaction and not an isodesmic reaction since the number of each bond type is not necessarily conserved in RC1. RC2 is what is typically thought of as an isodesmic reaction, where only the number and type of each bond is conserved without regard for the surrounding chemical environment. The bond types are equivalent to those defined by Petersson et al. and do not consider aromatic bond types. The next reaction class, RC3, adds the further restriction that the coordinationnumber for each atom on both sides of a bond must also be conserved. The coordination number for the atoms connected by the bond is then used to define a bond feature that separates different types of bonds. Take single C-C bond of ethane as an example, where the carbon atoms on two sides of this bond both have a coordination number of 3 (notice that by convention the carbon-carbon bond in question is excluded from the calculation of coordination number). However, for the single C-C bond in propylene, the \\(sp^{3}\\) carbon atom has a coordination number of 3 but the other \\(sp^{2}\\) carbon atom only has a coordination number of 2. Therefore, the C-C single bond of ethane and propylene are treated as different bond types. Finally, RC4 adds the further constraint that the identity of the neighboring atoms (i.e. atoms who are also bonded to at least one of the atoms in the original bond in question), as well as their own coordination numbers must also be conserved. The interested reader should see Buerger et al. [13] for excellent examples and illustrations that make the distinctions between these reaction classes clear. In this work, we have extended these reaction class definitions into further sub-types to address problems we encountered. For example, because our curated reference set includes anionic, cationic, and even zwitterionic species, we find that these species would often appear in the calculations for non-charged targets. Given that charged species are more likely to have significant errors from QM calculations, it would be better to bias the algorithm to choose neutrals as reference species when possible, especially for neutral targets. To solve this issue, we added the charged-constrained sub-class, which limits included species to have a formal charge no more anionic or cationic than what is present in the target species. Reactions that comply with this constraint are labeled with a subscript \"c\" (e.g., RC2_c, RC3_c, etc.). Another potential concern originates from the use of strained cyclic species, especially those with 3- or 4-member rings, as reference molecules, particularly for acyclic target molecules. To address this, we introduced a ring-constrained subclass (e.g., RC2_r). This subclass ensures conservation of the number and type of rings, while the specific atomic identities within the ring are not a priority. Note that these sub-classes are not mutually exclusive (e.g., RC2_cr exists and constrains both charges and rings). Furthermore, for heightened specificity, we integrated the \"scope\" subclass (e.g., RC2_s), which omits reference species with features not present in the target molecule. Normally these features are just the bonds defined by the various reaction classes; however, the charge subclass also adds charge as a feature to consider for scope, and the ring subclass adds rings of various sizes as a feature to consider for scope. Because of this, RC2_cs, RC2_rs, and RC2_crs are not the same, as they have different subsets of features they are constraining for scope. ### Automatic Isodesmic Reactions Among others, a great contribution of Buerger et al. is to show that isodesmic reactions can be found automatically using a computer algorithm, rather than having to be conceived of by hand. Their key insight is that finding isodesmic reaction can be viewed as a constrained optimization problem over the stoichiometric coefficients, \\(\\nu_{i}\\), for the reference species in the reaction. The constraints can ensure that the requirements of the reaction classes are satisfied, while minimizing the objective function determines which of the reference species should be included in the reaction. Given the size of the reference set, there are many different combinations of reference species that could be included while still satisfying the reaction class constraints. Given this, Buerger et al. chose an optimization scheme to try and find an isodesmic reaction that includes the fewest reference species and constraining features. Equation (6) shows the mixed-integer linear programming problem (MILP) defined by Buerger et al. to automatically find isodesmic reactions. \\[\\begin{split}\\min_{\\nu}&\\sum_{i}^{N_{\\rm ref}} \\left[|\\nu_{i}|\\cdot\\sum_{j}^{N_{\\rm constraints}}c_{ij}\\right]\\\\ {\\rm s.t.}&\\sum_{i}^{N_{\\rm ref}}\\nu_{i}c_{ij}=0 \\quad\\forall j\\in\\{1,\\ldots,N_{\\rm constraints}\\},\\\\ &\\nu_{i}>0\\quad\\forall i\\in\\{1,\\ldots,N_{\\rm ref}\\}\\end{split} \\tag{6}\\] In Equation (6), \\(\\nu_{i}\\) are the integer variables being optimized for overall \\(N_{\\rm ref}\\) reference species. \\(c_{ij}\\) are the number of each constraining feature \\(j\\) present in reference species \\(i\\). For example, if \\(j\\) is the index for a C-H bond in an RC2 scheme and \\(i\\) is for the reference species methane, \\(c_{ij}\\) is 4. The constraints of this minimization problem ensure that the conditions of the reaction class are met. We should note that the problem as posed in Equation (6) is not entirely linear in \\(\\nu_{i}\\) given the inclusion of the \\(|\\nu_{i}|\\) term. However, this problem can be recast as a linear problem by assigning separate variables \\(\\nu_{i}\\) when the reference species participates as a reactant rather than a product (while taking care of the proper sign of these variables in the constraints). The minimization procedure ensures that no reference species will participate as both a reactant and a product. In this work, we implement the algorithm of Buerger et al. as given in Equation 6 in the Arkane software package, along with constraints for the various reaction classes described previously, in order to calculate values for \\(\\Delta_{\\rm f}^{\\rm iso}H_{t}^{\\circ}\\) for a given target species automatically. By default, our implementation takes the median value for \\(\\Delta_{\\rm f}^{\\rm iso}H_{t}^{\\circ}\\) from 10 isodesmic reactions. To solve the MILP, lp_solve[46] is used, although a wrapper to use Pyomo[47, 48] is also implemented. In general, we find lp_solve to be significantly faster most of the time, though it is also prone to occasionally not converging to a solution. As a final implementation note, although any AECs or BACs applied to the reference species and target will ultimately cancel out, \\(\\Delta_{\\rm f}^{\\rm qm}H^{\\circ}\\) does include AECs for both the target and the reference species. This is because the values of \\(\\Delta_{\\rm f}^{\\rm qm}H^{\\circ}\\) for the reference species stored in the database include AECs so that the resulting values are at least somewhat reasonable and close to the reference values. ## Results and Discussion ### Performance of AEC, Petersson- and Melius-type BACs In order to compare the performance of the different types of BACs, both the training and leave-one-out cross-validation errors are considered for species in the reference set. Figure 3 and Figure 4 shows the distribution of errors for Petersson-type and Melius-type BACs, for all levels of theory described in Table 2, respectively. To better illustrate the effect of different corrections, we also show both the results from applying AECs only (\\(\\Delta_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\mathrm{aec}}H_{t}^{\\circ}\\), blue) and with BACs also applied (\\(\\Delta_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\mathrm{bac}}H_{t}^{\\circ}\\), orange). First, we notice that the distribution of errors with only AEC applied (\\(\\Delta_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\mathrm{aec}}H_{t}^{\\circ}\\)) is both wider and not centered at zero compared to those with BAC also applied (\\(\\Delta_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\mathrm{bac}}H_{t}^{\\circ}\\)), indicating that AEC alone often cannot sufficiently correct the large systematic errors commonly seen from QM calculations, and therefore additional corrections such as BAC and IDR are needed. Further, the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) of \\(\\Delta_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\mathrm{aec}}H_{t}^{\\circ}\\) generally decrease as the level of theory is increased. As expected, we observe that \\(\\Delta_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\mathrm{aec}}H_{t}^{\\circ}\\) calculated using wave function theory (WFT, e.g., LOT E, F, N, O) generally tends to be more accurate than those calculated using density functional theory (DFT). However, WFTs are substantially more expensive than DFTs, and therefore it is still important to identify DFT methods that can yield reasonable accuracy with lowered computational costs. When comparing different LOTs, it appears that the F12 correction plays an important role in improving accuracy for DLPNO methods (e.g., LOT D vs F). Notably, the \\(\\omega\\)B97M-V/def2-TZVPD DFT (LOT A) yields highly accurate results comparable to WFT methods, albeit at significantly lowered costs, making it an recommended method for calculating enthalpies. Moreover, the results clearly demonstrate that applying BACs can substantially boost the accuracy of calculated enthalpy values for all LOTs, and especially",

The differences between BACs and IDRs, like sensitivity to reference species errors and the need for constraints, are discussed.\n\nThe authors of a study by Buerger et al. introduce four isodesmic reaction classes (RC1-RC4) to optimize the cancellation of errors.

RC3 adds the constraint of equal coordination numbers, and RC4 further constrains the identity and coordination numbers of neighboring atoms.\n\nAutomatic identification of isodesmic reactions is achieved through a computer algorithm, solving a mixed-integer linear programming problem (MILP) as described by Buerger et al. in Equation (6).

The application of BACs significantly improves accuracy, with DFT methods, particularly when combined with the F12 correction, achieving high accuracy at reduced computational cost. This demonstrates the utility of combining different correction schemes in computational thermochemistry."

Unscaled version included in the SI. below 2.5 kcal/mol, and are near 2.0 kcal/mol for most DFT methods; further, LOT A, E, F, N, and O all yield near or sub 1.0 kcal/mol accuracy, making them promising candidates to achieve gold-standard thermochemistry. When it comes to the comparison between Melius-type and Petersson-type BACs, we observe similar levels of performance for most of the LOTs, and at first glance, it is not easy to determine which type of BAC generally performs better. We gain some insight, though, by considering both the training and cross-validation errors for these BACs. Table 3 breaks down both training and cross-validation errors at each LOT to facilitate comparison; the table also includes a \\(\\Delta\\) column that shows the difference between these two errors. As seen in Table 3, Petersson-type BACs almost always have lower training errors (both MAE and RMSE), while Melius-type BACs more often than not have slightly lower cross-validation errors, and m-BACs always have a smaller change in going from training errors to cross-validation errors. This result suggests that Melius-type BACs might generalize better to types of molecules that are not well represented in the reference set, and that Petersson-type BACs are more likely to be undermined by over-fitting, for p-BACs fit a single parameter to a fairly broad notion of a bond type (e.g., treating C-C bonds in benzene and ethane as the same). In unfortunate scenarios, it is therefore possible that Petersson-type BACs are fitted on a training set containing, for example, C-C bonds with substantial chemical differences from the C-C bond in target species, leading to poor performance in real-life tests and applications. Melius-type BACs on the other hand are inherently more flexible in distinguishing between bond types, though a diverse training set is still crucial. Overall, bond additivity correction is a promising approach to achieve high-quality thermochemistry, and the difference in cross-validation errors between m-BAC and p-BAC is not substantial, especially for higher levels of theory. The possibility of being able to generalize better and requiring slightly fewer parameters does give Melius-type BACs a slight advantage. Moreover, because the cost and performance vary by LOT, a future systemic evaluation and benchmark of more LOTs commonly used in literature for thermochemistry has the high potential to offer deeper insights into choosing the optimal LOT for different types of chemistry. ### Performance of isodesmic reactions Analyzing the effectiveness of isodesmic reaction methods requires a more involved approach. For each species \\(i\\) in the reference set, we can treat the species as if it is a target species and calculate \\(\\Delta_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\mathrm{iso}}H_{i}^{\\circ}\\) using the remaining species in the reference set (i.e., leave-one-out cross-validation), and then compute the error as \\(\\Delta_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\mathrm{iso}}H_{i}^{\\circ}\\) - \\(\\Delta_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\mathrm{ref}}H_{i}^{\\circ}\\) for different LOTs or reaction classes as defined previously. However, there are two complexities that merit consideration. First, not all species can be calculated using the IDR appraoch. For example, if a certain type of bond or constraint is only found in a small number of species in the reference set, then it may be impossible to construct an isodesmic reaction using only the species in the reference set (excluding the target). This inadequate training set problem becomes increasingly evident for higher-order (i.e., more constrained) reaction classes. The second complexity is that while a certain reaction class might be specified, it is always possible that the median isodesmic reaction used for the final value for \\(\\Delta_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\mathrm{iso}}H^{\\circ}\\) is also a member of a higher order reaction class. Because of these complexities, we choose to analyze the IDR approach with only LOT A through F, for the main purpose here is to examine the general performance of IDR instead of attempting to fit IDR for all LOTs. Figures 5, 6, and 7 show errors for each reference species that could be calculated with isodesmic reactions for reaction classes (distinguished by color in the figure) at least as strict as RC2, RC3, and RC4, respectively. Figure 5 shows that although a reaction class as low as RC2 is requested (and thus only RC2 type constraints are considered when using Equation (6), the median reaction found is always a higher order reaction class. In fact, the median reaction is always at least of class RC3 or higher. This is not entirely surprising, as the distinction between RC2 and RC3 is small, with RC3 only considering the aforementioned coordination numbers as additional bond information. Consequently, Figures 5 and 6 look very similar. While the more strict sub-classes are often satisfied as well in both cases, the number of RC4 class reactions found by chance is extremely small, for RC4 reactionsFigure 5: Errors between \\(\\Delta_{\\rm f}^{\\rm iso}H^{\\circ}\\) and known values of \\(\\Delta_{\\rm f}^{\\rm ref}H^{\\circ}\\) using species from the reference set and isodesmic reactions of class RC2 or stricter. Figure 6: Errors between \\(\\Delta_{\\rm f}^{\\rm iso}H^{\\circ}\\) and known values of \\(\\Delta_{\\rm f}^{\\rm ref}H^{\\circ}\\) using species from the reference set and isodesmic reactions of class RC3 or stricter. are substantially more restrictive. In fact, Figure 7 shows that only a small portion of the reference species can be calculated using RC4 class reactions or higher. It appears at first glance that the errors associated with RC4 reactions are smaller than either RC2 or RC3, but making this direct comparison is tenuous due to the different populations of species being represented. Species that can be calculated by RC4 reactions are likely well represented in the reference set, which includes a disproportionate number of easier-to-calculate species such as simple alkanes. However, regardless of whether smaller populations provide an advantage, the errors observed from using isodesmic reactions seem considerably greater than the two BAC approach discussed previously. The distribution of errors appears to be wider, and there appear to be more outlier values for isodesmic reactions. Therefore, considering the increased error, coupled with the fact that many species cannot be easily calculated using IDR, the automatic IDR fitting method described so far does not seem advantageous. Yet, we think there are potential remedies that merit further exploration. We note that the optimization procedure in Equation (6), while capable of finding isodesmic reactions automatically, is set up to prioritize isodesmic reactions that are simple. Figure 7: Errors between \\(\\Delta_{\\text{f}}^{\\text{iso}}H^{\\circ}\\) and known values of \\(\\Delta_{\\text{f}}^{\\text{ref}}H^{\\circ}\\) using species from the reference set and isodesmic reactions of class RC4 or stricter. Other than ensuring that the constraints of the reaction class are satisfied, the optimization itself does not attempt to differentiate between isodesmic reactions using some metric of quality, leaving this task entirely up to the reaction classes. As a result, the current procedure does not allow for any further optimization within a reaction class. For instance, one aspect that is worth considering is the data quality of the species included in the isodesmic reaction since some species in the reference set might have a poor geometry at the given level of theory. Buerger et al. were aware of this issue and their solution was to perform a careful prunning of the reference set to remove species that seemed to be inconsistent with the rest of the reference set because these species were considered to have high chances of yielding large error. Instead of using the approach of Buerger et al., we contemplated embedding a metric to evaluate species data quality directly into the optimization procedure. Our approach thus leads to an optimization procedure designed to minimize the expected errors of the species involved in the isodesmic reaction. One method to gauge the uncertainty of a reference value is to use the difference in the known heat of formation of the reference species with the heat of formation calculated with just AECs at the given level of theory, i.e., \\(\\Delta_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\mathrm{ref}}H_{i}^{\\circ}-\\Delta_{\\mathrm{f}}^{ \\mathrm{a}\\mathrm{a}\\mathrm{e}}H_{i}^{\\circ}\\). Equation (7) summarizes our approach, which preferentially includes reference species that are well represented by the given LOT while still enforcing the constraints of the reaction class. Since including more species in the isodesmic reaction would only lead to more terms in the objective function, the objective function we defined here should behave similarly to that of Buerger et al. More specifically, optimizing Equation (7) should yield simple IDRs with rewards giving to reactions that have reference species with less uncertainty in enthalpies. \\[\\begin{split}\\min_{\\nu}&\\sum_{i}^{N_{\\mathrm{ref}}} \\left[|\\nu_{i}|\\cdot|\\Delta_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\mathrm{ref}}H_{i}^{\\circ}-\\Delta_{ \\mathrm{f}}^{\\mathrm{a}\\mathrm{e}}H_{i}^{\\circ}|\\right]\\\\ \\mathrm{s.t.}&\\sum_{i}^{N_{\\mathrm{ref}}}\\nu_{i}c_{ ij}=0\\quad\\forall j\\in\\{1,\\ldots,N_{\\mathrm{constraints}}\\},\\\\ &\\nu_{i}>0\\quad\\forall i\\in\\{1,\\ldots,N_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\}\\end{split} \\tag{7}\\]Using Equation (7) as the optimization algorithm, Figure 8 shows the resulting errors for using isodesmic reactions of class RC2 and higher.However, it appears that the errors are not significantly different from those achieved in Figure 5 where Equation (6) is used. The lackluster performance can possibly be attributed to \\(|\\Delta_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\mathrm{ref}}H_{i}^{\\circ}-\\Delta_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\mathrm{ aec}}H_{i}^{\\circ}|\\) is a poor estimator of the quality of the included reference species (i.e., its expected error at a given level of theory). We note that \\(\\Delta_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\mathrm{aec}}H_{i}^{\\circ}\\) are simply the heats of formation with AECs applied to them (see the methodology section where we explain this implementation detail), which as we see in Figures 3 and 4 have a wide distribution that usually not centered around zero. Because the errors in \\(\\Delta_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\mathrm{aec}}H_{i}^{\\circ}\\) does not follow a standard normal distribution, the proposed objective function may favor species at the tail of the distribution to minimize an incorrectly estimated expected error, leading to poor species choices. Therefore, it is worth considering a different estimator for the quality of the reference species at the given level of theory. The next obvious choice here is to replace \\(\\Delta_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\mathrm{aec}}H_{i}^{\\circ}\\) with \\(\\Delta_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\mathrm{bac}}H_{i}^{\\circ}\\), as the errors in heats of formation calculated with BACs are much narrower in distribution, and crucially centered around zero. Equation (8) updates Equation (7) with this Figure 8: Errors between \\(\\Delta_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\mathrm{iso}}H^{\\circ}\\) and known values of \\(\\Delta_{\\mathrm{f}}^{\\mathrm{ref}}H^{\\circ}\\) using the optimization algorithm from Equation (7). Isodesmic reactions of class RC2 or stricter were considered. approach in mind. Note that BAC data is only being used to help us algorithmically favor reference species that are likely well captured at this level of theory. Any BACs applied to the reference species and target would cancel out anyways in an isodesmic reaction approach. Melius-type BACs were chosen for this implementation. Figure 9 shows the resulting errors from using the optimization scheme given by Equation (8) for reaction class RC2 or stricter. The distribution of errors given by this approach is much narrower. Furthermore, at a quick glance the errors using this approach appear to be on-par or even slightly better than those obtained through BAC approaches. However, once again we note that this direct comparison is tenuous, for the population of species is not the same because once again this approach could not find isodesmic reactions for all of the reference species as explained previously. Figure 9: Errors between \\(\\Delta_{\\text{f}}^{\\text{iso}}H^{\\circ}\\) and known values of \\(\\Delta_{\\text{f}}^{\\text{ref}}H^{\\circ}\\) using the optimization algorithm from Equation (8). Isodesmic reactions of class RC2 or stricter were considered. To better compare the performance of BAC approaches to this new isodesmic reaction algorithm, we constructed parity plots, where the x-axis is the error from isodesmic reactions while the y-axis is the error from applying Melius-type BACs. Each data point represents a single reference species that was able to be calculated both by BACs and isodesmic reactions. This gets around the issue of separate populations, and allows for a fair comparison between the method. Furthermore, an abundance of points above or below the parity line tells us which method is performing better most of the time. The parity plot comparing cross-validation errors of Melius-type BACs and isodesmic reactions found using Equation (8) can be seen in Figure 10. All of the data correspond to LOT F, and are separated out by the various reactions classes (strictly held, so any RC3 reactions are not also RC4). Comparing these two methods, it appears that the species appear above the parity line (favoring isodesmic reactions) slightly more often than they appear below it (favoring BACs), though this observation is not consistent across all reaction classes.

The leave-one-out cross-validation mean absolute errors (MAEs) for formation enthalpies, denoted as \\(\\Delta_{\\text{f}}^{\\text{p-bac}}H_{t}^{\\circ}\\), exhibit minimal errors below 2.5 kcal/mol, with the majority around 2.0 kcal/mol.LOTs A, E, F, N, and O, in particular, display near or below 1.0 kcal/mol accuracy, indicating their potential for achieving high-accuracy thermochemistry.\n\nWhen comparing two types of bond-additivity corrections, Melius-type and Petersson-type, both exhibit comparable performance across most lots. Initial inspection does not conclusively determine which BAC performs better, but a closer examination reveals that Petersson-type BACs generally have lower training errors, while Melius-type often has slightly lower cross-validation errors. This suggests that Melius-type might generalize better to unseen molecular types and is less prone to overfitting due to its more bond-type-specific nature. However, Melius-type BACs require a diverse training set, while Petersson-type fits a single parameter to a broader bond definition.\n\nThe performance of isodesmic reactions, which involve constructing equivalent reactions for reference species, is more complex. Not all species can be calculated using the isodesmic approach, especially for those with unique constraints or rare bond types. The median reactions found tend to be more complex than initially specified, with RC4 reactions being extremely rare. Despite some improvements in error for stricter reaction classes, the overall errors associated with isodesmic reactions are generally larger and less consistent compared to the BAC methods.\n\nTo assess the effectiveness of the isodesmic reactions, a modified approach using a combination of reference species from LOT A to F is employed. While the results from using Equation (6) for RC2 or stricter isodesmic reactions are similar to those without BACs, optimizing with Equation (7) using the difference in AEC and BAC heats of formation (Equation 8) leads to a narrower error distribution. The parity plots comparing these two methods show that neither consistently outperforms the other, with an average advantage of nearly zero, suggesting that both BAC and isodesmic approaches have their merits depending on the specific system.\n\nIn conclusion, bond-additivity corrections and isodesmic reaction methods各有优劣 in achieving high-quality thermodynamics, and the optimal choice depends on the specific chemistry and the available data. Further systematic evaluations and benchmarks involving more commonly used LOTs in thermochemistry research are recommended to better understand and select the most suitable approach for different applications."

            "input_text": "methods are roughly on-par performance-wise. That being said, we are still left with the fact that Melius-type BACs work for all species, which is not true of the isodesmic reaction approach, giving Melius-type BACs a significant advantage. As a final observation, we note that in Figure 10 the error from isodesmic reactions goes down as the reaction class is increased. Yet, the species that can be predicted using these higher-order reactions classes are also well predicted by using Melius-type BACs. It is unclear if the origin of this phenomena is because being able to use higher order reaction classes means that the target species is well represented in the reference database, which likely also helps Melius-type BACs, or if these well represented species also happen to be species that are better captured by the given level of theory. Either way, it may be possible to predict which species have especially low errors at a given level of theory based on if they can be calculated using a higher order isodesmic reaction scheme. Figure 10: Parity plots showcasing the performance of isodesmic reactions found from Equation (8) and Melius-type BACs for a given species in the reference set at LOT F. Data points below the parity line indicate that using isodesmic reactions resulted in a lower error for that species than using Melius-type BACs. The BAC advantage is the average difference between using Melius-type BACs versus isodesmic reactions, with a negative value indicating that isodesmic reactions performed better. ## Conclusions In this work, we implement several approaches for correcting heats of formation obtained through quantum chemistry calculations. Part of this work includes compiling and curating a database (available in the SI) of reference species and thermochemistry data from the literature that contained a diverse set of molecules so that these approaches could be applied to a broad range of molecules. This implementation is available to use with the open-source Arkane software [14], which allows everyone to use these methods and even contribute new parameters for additional levels of theory using the developed application programming interface (API) for fitting parameters and adding new information to the database. Because all of the information needed to fit parameters is stored in the reference species files in the database, it is also possible to replicate our results and regenerate improved corrections. As for the performance of the various methods, Petersson-type and Melius-type BACs show very similar performance, though Melius-type BACs appear to generalize better. Both approaches are a substantial improvement over just using AECs, though, as previously noted in the literature. By comparison, isodesmic reactions do not appear to perform as well as using BACs, unless care is taken to optimize for including reference species that likely have low errors. In this work, we build on the optimization method of Buerger et al., and demonstrate that the performance of automatic IDR is on-par or slightly better than using BACs even with improved objective functions. Although we did not do so here, it would be interesting to compare our improved automatic IDR approach with the pruning approach used by Buerger et al. to achieve a similar end of preferring certain reference species. While the accuracy of many IDRs are comparable to that of BACs, the isodesmic reaction approaches still have the downside that not all species can be calculated using them, as the reference set needs to include enough high-quality species with relevant chemical features. With this, in general, we recommend using Melius-type BACs to obtain accurate enthalpies of formation due to its slight advantages. That being said, using Petersson-typeBACs should be viewed as almost equivalent, especially if the target species is well represented in the reference set. Similarly, calculations from isodesmic reactions could also be viewed as almost equivalent if substantial care is taken to choose appropriate reference species, and higher reaction classes are used. Last but not least, given the variance in both cost and performance across different levels of theory, there is a compelling need for a systematic review and benchmarking of enthalpies of formation calculated via LOTs frequently cited in thermochemical literature. Such an effort promises to offer profound insights, guiding researchers in choosing the most suitable LOT for specific chemical contexts, and advancing our progress in efficiently obtaining accurate thermochemical values for a wide variety of molecules.",

To ensure broad applicability, we compile and curate a comprehensive database of reference compounds and thermodynamic data from diverse molecular sources, accessible through the open-source Arkane software. The software provides an application programming interface (API) for users to adopt these methods and contribute new parameters for enhanced theoretical levels.\n\nThe implemented methods, particularly Petersson-type and Melius-type Bond Addition Correction (BAC) schemes, exhibit comparable performance, with Melius-type showing better generalization capabilities. Both outperform the simple use of Atomization Energy Corrections (AECs), as reported in previous literature. However, isodesmic reactions, though potentially useful, are less effective unless carefully optimized to include species with low error estimates.\n\nAutomatic Implicit Definition Reaction (IDR) methods, although nearly as efficient as BACs with improved objective functions, demonstrate on-par or slightly better performance. Despite this, a direct comparison with the pruning method employed by Buerger et al. would be insightful. While some IDRs can rival BAC accuracy, isodesmic reactions are limited by their dependency on a well-represented reference set.\n\nWhile Melius-type BACs are generally recommended for accurate enthalpy determinations due to their slight advantages, both Petersson-type and isodesmic reactions can be considered viable options under specific circumstances. For instance, if the target species is adequately covered in the reference set, using either type of BAC is nearly equivalent. For isodesmic reactions, careful selection of reference species and the employment of higher reaction orders can improve their performance.\n\nConsidering the varying costs and performance across different levels of theory (LOTs), a systematic review and benchmarking of heats of formation is urgently needed in the thermochemical literature. Such an evaluation would provide crucial guidance for selecting the most appropriate LOT for specific chemical contexts and advance our ability to accurately calculate thermodynamic values for a wide array of molecules."
