Reductive eliminations involving fluoroalkyl groups have been demonstrated at higher valent states of nickel,[1, 2, 3, 4] the generation of fluoroalkyl radicals via electron transfer or atom abstraction reactions of fluoroalkyl electrophiles with nickel is known,[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] fluoroalkyl-based transmetalating reagents readily react with nickel,[13, 14, 15] and catalytic transformations involving select fluoroalkyl groups have been reported.[16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 10, 22, 6] Nickel is also an earth-abundant metal with a reasonably low cost. However, most of the aforementioned chemical transformations involving fluoroalkyl groups required nickel to bear stabilizing ligands other than solvent. While in many cases ligands can serve to tune and enable the reactivity of a nickel center, in other cases they can prevent catalysis through redistributions that affect the speciation of an active form of the nickel catalyst. Moreover, extraneous non-solvento ligands raise the cost of a chemical process and can even contribute to the air-sensitivity of the system. Given these considerations, we became interested in developing new fluoroalkylation methods with nickel that employed solvent as theonly coordinating ligand. Such reaction conditions have commonly been referred to as \"ligandless\" conditions in other systems.[22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]",

Usually, you need to add things to the nickel to make the reactions happen, but it can be hard to figure out what to use. It can also make the process more expensive and harder to work with. We want to see if we can find ways to make the reactions happen using only things that can dissolve in water. This has been done before in other systems and is known as \"ligandless\" conditions."

These results clearly show that upon oxidation of acetonitrile-supported nickel fluoroalkyl complexes, the fluoroalkyl groups can be transferred to organic substrates. Secondly, the electrochemical analysis of [(MeCN)Ni\\({}^{\\dagger}\\)(C\\({}_{2}\\)F\\({}_{5}\\))\\({}_{3}\\)]\\({}^{-}\\) suggests that, upon electro-oxidation to [(MeCN)\\({}_{n}\\)Ni\\({}^{\\dagger\\#}\\)(C\\({}_{2}\\)F\\({}_{5}\\))\\({}_{3}\\)], reductive hemolysis of a perfluoroethyl radical occurs, with the concomitant formation of [(MeCN)Ni\\({}^{\\dagger\\#}\\)(C\\({}_{2}\\)F\\({}_{5}\\))\\({}_{2}\\)]. This electrochemical behavior shows generality with trifluoromethyl derivatives.[29] Lastly, catalytic C-H trifluoromethylations of electron rich arenes were successfully achieved using either [(MeCN)Ni(CF\\({}_{3}\\))\\({}_{3}\\)]\\({}^{-}\\) or the related [Ni(CF\\({}_{3}\\))\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2-}\\).

Lastly, we found that nickel can put trifluoromethyl groups into electron-rich organic compounds with help from fluorescent organic compounds."

The covalency was analyzed, on one hand, by changes in the concentration of the electron density at the BCP along with changes in the delocalization indices. On the other hand, energy densities show the polarization of the covalent bond by looking at the ratios between potential [V(r)] and kinetic [G(r)] energy densities, which for partial covalent bonds lie in between values of 1 and 2. The total energy density shows the degree of covalency that is represented by the level of predominance of the potential over the kinetic energy density [42].",

For assay formats that require molecular recognition, incorporation of nylon[10] or nitrocellulose[28] membranes into device designs can support reagent immobilization by physisorption and capture of analytes under continuous flow. Alternatively, the surfaces of cellulosic paper fibers can be functionalized chemically[29, 30, 31] or biochemically (e.g., via engineered proteins)[32, 33] to support the immobilization of reagents.[34, 35] Detection reagents can also be crosslinked throughout the open pore structure of a paper substrate to create an immobilized network of materials that would otherwise diffuse throughout the paper architecture.[36, 37] While these approaches provide assay developers with a variety of device design options, they each require target analytes to be captured or reagent-specific functionalization strategies to restrict the formation of a colorimetric signal to a defined location.",

Some ways use nylon or nitrocellulose membranes and some use chemicals or proteins to stick reagents to paper fibers. These reagents capture analytes and create a color.

The fluidic network patterned into the device splits a single sample inlet into separate and ultimately opposing channels. Analytes can undergo partial reactions with unique reagents stored in each channel. The products of these partial reactions are directed towards a common test zone. Others have shown paper devices designed for the sequential, timed delivery of reagents from multiple channels that are directed towards a test zone.[38, 39] In these devices, flow is continuous as long as sufficient volume is available to saturate the paper. Because paper-based devices are inherently self-metering,[5] if a single channel is split and recombined, net fluid flow stops when the advancing fluid fronts meet. At this interface between fronts, where reactions between previously separated reagents are now possible and controlled by diffusion, assay products can be isolated without affinity-based capture and lead to the formation of colorimetric signals that are confined to the contour of the interface. Using this device design strategy, we demonstrate the detection of multiple classes of analytes--ions, small molecules, and enzymes--by producing line-format signals like those provided by LFTs but resulting from soluble reaction products. We demonstrate our approach by developing assays for iron (III), acetylcholinesteraseiesterase, and lactate. Additionally, we demonstrate the scalability of this method by increasing the number of fluid fronts that converge in a common detection zone to create multiplexed assays: two converging channels create one interface (i.e., singleplex) while three or four converging channels create three or four interfaces, respectively (i.e., multiplex). We demonstrate the ability to create multiple lines in common zone by combining test and control assays for both iron (III) and acetylcholinesteraseiesterase. Overall, these devices provide a new method of generating user-friendly signal formats for analytes that are currently incompatible with molecular recognition-style assay architectures.",

It can read many different chemicals at once and give different colors to different types of chemicals. This is a great way to test different things in the body, like how well a medicine is working or how much enzyme is being made in cells. It also makes the tests a lot easier to read and understand."

For assays that require reagents with different chemical properties (e.g., solubility, rehydration rate, or interactions with the surrounding paper matrix) to be stored on opposite sides of the device, channel lengths may be adjusted to provide timed convergence of liquid fronts at the desired location [11, 41]. This approach is shown in Figure S1A, in which an interface formed between two solutions of colored dyes was shifted from the center of the device detection zone using an asymmetrical channel geometry. Additionally, the position of the formed interface is dependent on the geometries of patterned paper layer features and proper layer alignment [42, 43]. We developed a layer alignment pin tool and protocol to position device features reproducibly and ensure the interface position is only dependent on synchronized delivery of fluid fronts to the detection zone (Figure S2). This approach consistently provides interfaces at the center of device detection zones (Figure S1B). In the assays described below, a symmetrical channel design reproducibly afforded interfaces in the center of the test zone.",

The where the interface is made also depends on the patterns in the paper sheets and how they're put together. We made a tool and method to help put the device features in the right place so that the interface is always in the middle of the detection zone.

In these interface-forming devices, however, detection zones are not in direct, vertical fluidic connection with patterned features on the previous layer.

In the single-analyte detection format, reagents are stored within the device such that one channel contains analyte-specific reagents, and the other channel contains a product-specific indicator. Upon introduction of the sample, a partial reaction occurs in the channel containing analyte-specific reagents. As the two liquid fronts converge, the assay is completed by reaction between the formed product and the product-specific indicator.

The time required to generate visible signals can vary based on the grade of paper used to fabricate the device (Table S2). We used Whatman 4 for all layers of our paper-based device and observed that signal formation starts at approximately 2 minutes. Products accumulate over time and cause an increase in signal intensity, until saturating at approximately 7 minutes after the sample was added (Figure 2A). Additionally, the gradual increase in signal intensity causes nearly linear broadening of the width of the formed interface over time, which eventually compromises signal intensity. Therefore, we determined the ideal signal read time is between 7-10 minutes, with the cut off time for signal interpretation to be 20 minutes. Prior to the cut off time, the signal intensity is at a maximum value and can be used for qualitative detection, which we demonstrate with Fe(III) ions (Figure 2B). Signal intensities at 2 minutes and 100 minutes resulted in similar intensity values (data not shown). Longer times lead to diminishing signal intensity due to diffusion of product.",

However, we found that it was best to look at the signals between 7 and 10 minutes, with 20 minutes as the cut off time (Figure 2B).

To detect Fe(III), we stored ascorbic acid (a reducing agent) and 3-(2-pyridyl)-5,6-diphenyl-1,2,4-triazine-p,p'-disulfonic acid (Ferrozine; a colorimetric indicator of Fe(II))[46] in opposite channels of the reagent storage layer (Figure 3A). When a sample is added to the device, it is split uniformly intoeach channel where it rehydrates and can react with these stored reagents. If Fe(III) is present in the sample, it will be reduced to Fe(II) in the channel containing ascorbic acid, while no reactions will occur in the channel containing Ferrozine. When the two wicking fronts converge at the detection zone on the bottom layer of the device, reduced Fe(II) is chelated by Ferrozine and forms a purple signal at the formed interface (Figure 3B, Figure S4).",

We stored ascorbic acid and Ferrozine in the different parts of the test device, which looked like a puzzle. When we put a sample in, it was split into two parts and reacted with the stored chemicals. If the sample had Fe(III) in it, it would be changed to Fe(II) and it would not react with Ferrozine.

This color, a reaction product with Ferrozine, could be caused by Fe(II) impurities in either the Fe(III) sample or the paper[47]. We minimized the background signal by incorporating ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in the Ferrozine side of the sample distribution layer[48]. We tested both the effect of different EDTA and Ferrozine concentrations on the signal to background ratio (Table S3, Table S4). As the concentration of Ferrozine increased, the intensities of both the signal formed at the readout zone and the background increased. The increase in background intensity did not negatively impact the signal to background ratio, which increased proportionally with the concentration of Ferrozine. However, the increase in signal to background ratio in the presence of EDTA was higher than that without using EDTA, which further suggests that the incorporation of EDTA provided superior results (Table S3, Table S4).",

AChE hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into choline and acetic acid to terminate neurotransmission at the cholinergic synapse. Inhibition of AChE by organophosphates, heavy metals, or chemical warfare agents can block acetylcholine transmission and lead to organ failure and death [50]. We chose AChE as a model analyte to evaluate how interfaces were formed when reactions were governed by two time-dependent processes: (i) the activity of the enzyme (i.e., the analyte) and (ii) diffusion and mixing of reactants across the interface. To detect AChE, we stored acetylcholine chloride and 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB, Ellman's reagent) on opposite sides of the reagent storage layer (Figure S6). When AChE is present in the added sample, it reacts with acetylcholine to produce acetic acid and thiocholine (Figure 4A). At the interface, the unmasked sulfhydryl group on the thiocholine interacts with DTNB to generate 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoic acid and form a yellow signal that we could quantify with image analysis. As expected for an enzymatic assay, the signal intensities saturated over time. Similar to the Fe(III) assay, signal from AChE assay took approximately two minutes to start forming and increased in width and intensity over time. To ensure color saturation, we used the scans taken 10 minutes after sample addition to analyze the signal intensity formed at the interface. We performed nonlinear regression of the data using a saturation growth model for concentrations of AChE ranging from 2-30 U/mL (Figure 4B). From the fit, we determined that there was a nearly linear relationship between the concentration of AChE and measured signal between 2-10 U/mL, and signals at higher concentrations were saturated and could be detected but not quantified. While the physiological range of AChE in plasma is greater than 8 U/mL [51], exposure to dangerous chemical agents (e.g., organophosphates) results in a reduction of AChE activity into the linear range of this assay. While it can be hard to detect yellow lines on white backgrounds with the naked eye, especially at lower analyte concentrations, this AChE assay remains useful to provide a visual reference for qualitative detection (i.e., \"yes or no\" presence of analyte).

We measured the yellow signals to see how much AChE was present. The yellow signals got stronger as the concentration of AChE increased. The AChE concentration in a person's body is high, but when exposed to dangerous chemicals, it goes down and gets back to a normal level.\n\nWe used a device with 3-D printing to do the test. We tried different reactants to find the right one. The yellow signals helped us see if AChE was there, and we can change the reactants to make the yellow signals stronger.

We chose lactate as a model analyte to demonstrate how the device can accommodate multistep reactions. To detect lactate, we stored (i) nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and (ii) 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolzolium bromide (MTT) on opposite sides of the second layer of the device (Figure 5A).

For the lactate assay, the detected concentration range was 2-50 mM (Figure 5B). Unlike Fe(lll) and AChE assays, we analyzed results of lactate assay approximately 4 minutes after sample addition to avoid increased background signal over time. The high noise is likely due to both MTT and PMS reagents causing a yellow background color. Since the assay involves enzymatic reactions, we analyzed the results by nonlinear regression using a growth and saturation model. The data showed a nearly linear relationship between signal intensity (green channel) at concentrations of lactate less than 20 mM. At higher concentrations of lactate, the signal saturated and resulted in detectable but not quantifiable signal (Figure 5C).

Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis on rinsed product obtained by HF-modulated synthesis shows that all the observed crystals are contaminated with fluoride inclusions (Figures 1c and S36). This evidence indicates that Al(F)bdc is present as crystalline domains within MIL-53 crystals rather than as a pure phase. This is further corroborated by the absence of structured diffuse scattering in high-resolution SCXRD data from contaminated crystals (Figures S54-S55)[40, 41]. Additionally, a minor fraction of the crystals exhibit a higher density of aluminium and fluorine, in line with the previously reported presence of undesired AlF\\({}_{3}\\) (Figure 1c, Figure S36, and Table S3)[32]. Considering all the evidence, it can be concluded that the use of fluoride modulation in MIL-53 synthesis yields crystals with inclusions of Al(F)bdc, and AlF\\({}_{3}\\) as by-product.",

Moreover, nitrogen sorption measurements show no substantial difference, in terms of BET surface area and pore volume, between the unmodulated and the oxalic acid-modulated products (Figure 1d). By comparison, the products obtained by using HF show instead a loss of BET area and pore volume of approximately 10%. Since this difference is mainly attributable to the presence of impurities of non-porous AlF\\({}_{3}\\) in the sample (-4.5% w/w calculated from the TGA profile), it is not possible to assess with precision the effects of the fluoride inclusions in the MIL-53 framework based on the sorption behaviour.

The unmodified crystals and the ones made in a special way with oxalic acid were compared and found to be the same.\nHowever, the crystals made with another type of acid called HF didn't have the same surface area and open spaces. This is likely because there were impurities in the sample that were calculated to be about 4.5% of the weight, based on a special machine called TGA (Figure S37).\nThis experiment shows that fluoride-based modulation is bad for the MOF's crystallinity and that oxalic acid can help improve it without changing the composition."

These MOFs were synthesized using 0.5, 1, and 1.5 oxalic acid:Al ratios to study how the amount of modulator affects the crystallinity of the products. In all the studied systems, oxalic acid leads to an increased crystal size with respect to the unmodulated synthesis (Figure 2, Figures S9-S23). Interestingly, a higher modulator-to-Al ratio does not always result in improved crystallinity. Indeed, in the cases of OH- and CH\\({}_{3}\\)O-MIL-53, an excessive amount of modulator leads to the stabilisation of a specific size or the absence of solid products, respectively. This behaviour can be attributed to the electron-donor character of OH and CH\\({}_{3}\\)O groups[45], which lowers the acidity of terephthalatic acid by destabilising its conjugated base[46]. Additionally, the pH decrease due to the MOF synthesis and to the formation of aluminium oxalate complexes further disfavours the deprotonation of the linkers, thus diminishing their reactivity. Our results show that the combination of these effects can allow for the tuning of the product's size distribution, in addition to its crystallinity. However, to achieve such control several aspects should be considered, in particular the modulator concentration, the species formed during the synthesis, and the chemical properties of the linker. Therefore, the adequate conditions to stabilize a specific size must be optimised for every system.",

These signals are attributable to a local ordering of the NO\\({}_{2}\\) groups, which can be found disordered in four equivalent positions for every linker after the MOF assembly. The effect of the modulator in slowing the crystal growth can favour this ordering and allow the formation of larger ordered domains, which could grow clustered in polycrystalline aggregates like those observed by SEM for the products obtained with the highest modulator concentration. Further experiments to confirm this hypothesis and determine the ordering of the NO\\({}_{2}\\) groups will be the focus of our future research.",

The researchers also looked at the shapes of the crystals and found that there are places where the NO\\_{2} groups are in a special order.

We attribute this remarkable versatility to oxalic acid's synergistic action in both binding the metals and protonating the linkers, thus introducing a substantial control over the MOF nucleation and regulating the crystal growth. Furthermore, we described how the strong differences between its characteristic five-membered ring chelation and the linker's coordination mode in the studied materials allow the modulating function without causing substitutional defects. These advantages do not apply in the case of modulators whose coordination capabilities are compatible with those found in the IBUs, such as fluoride or monocarboxylate species.

Also, correlations between dynamic ground state orbital angular momentum and excited state coupling terms and their relations to spin-phonon coupling terms are drawn for the first time. Specific group theoretical correlations between high and lower symmetry point groups further provide a means to evaluate spin-phonon coupling terms across transition metal complexes and molecular qubits featuring different ligand sets, geometries, and coordination numbers.

The shape of these shapes is determined by the angle between three tiny pieces of this chemical compound (Cl-Cu-Cl). Scientists have used many different methods to understand these different shapes. By comparing their calculations to these methods, scientists have come up with a way to understand how these atoms are bonded together (like holding hands). They did this by adding a certain amount of a certain type of relationship between atoms (Hartree-Fock exchange) into their method. This method has been used to do the calculations presented in the next part. In the way they did their calculations, the scientists figured out how much of this help should be added for each case they studied."

When the copper atoms are at the center of this structure, it makes the excited atoms be able to get mixed with the regular atoms. This can happen in a special way that reduces the energy of both the regular and excited atoms.

            "input_text": "Above, we have outlined a general LFT model of spin-phonon coupling terms in S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) transition metal complexes. This model is derived from the first and second derivatives of the LFT expressions of g-values given in Section 2.1[54]. While these expressions define the zero temperature magnitudes of spin-phonon coupling terms in S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) complexes, they can be expanded to consider additional dynamic effects through the variance of g\\({}_{z}\\), \\(\\langle g_{z}^{2}\\rangle\\), which highlights the importance of the first derivative, \\(\\frac{\\partial g_{z}}{\\partial q_{l}}\\), and therefore its role in the coherence lifetimes of S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) transition metal complexes. This suggests that, without considering thermal population, odd modes such as totally symmetric stretches will have a more substantial effect on spin-phonon coupling terms and decoherence compared to even modes, in which their value of relevance, \\(\\frac{\\partial^{2}g_{z}}{\\partial q_{l}^{2}}\\), only appears in the second order term of the Taylor expansion (equation 5). The fundamental behavior of these expressions were borne out by an extensive range of DFT and TD-DFT calculations on minimalistic S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) models, \\(D_{4h}\\)/\\(D_{2d}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- and \\(C_{\\mathcal{H}}\\) [VOCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)-. Together, the results above provide a general description of the roles of transition metal geometric and electronic structure in spin-phonon coupling. For instance, the magnitudes of spin-phonon coupling terms are strongly influenced by excited state SOC of orbital angular momentum into the ground state and are predicted to be strongly influenced by the energy of the particular ligand field excited state mixing with the ground state (equations 6 and 7) (e.g., \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{2g}\\) for a \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{1g}\\) ground state in \\(D_{4h}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)-). This excited state SOC contribution is governed by the ligand field geometry about the metal complex. For example, going from \\(D_{4h}\\) to \\(D_{2d}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- turns on additional mode coupling terms due to the enhancement of excited state coupling terms (Figure 4). Furthermore, the magnitude of spin-phonon coupling terms are strongly influenced by the covalency of ligand-metal bonds. This dynamic effect largely reflects a relativistic nephelauxetic effect, which effectively modulates the SOC constant of the metal from that of the free ion. In short, the more covalent the ligand-metal bond, the smaller the spin-phonon coupling terms become. Relatedly, a significant overall reduction in SOC constant can of course be achieved through the use of different transition metal complexes (e.g., V(IV) vs. Cu(II) vs. Cr(V)). As shown below, V(IV), which has a significantly lower SOC constant than Cu(II), can still maintain favorable spin-phonon coupling terms despite having significantly more ionic ligand-metal bonds than Cu(II) complexes. Complications can also arise from trying to quantify spin-phonon coupling terms in different ligand field environments, as the nature of the modes can change. However, this can be facilitated to some degree by leveraging specific group theoretical correlations as demonstrated here for \\(D_{4h}\\), \\(D_{2d}\\), and \\(C_{\\mathcal{H}}\\) transition metal complexes. The spin-phonon analyses presented above for [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- and [VOCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- are now extended to a range of S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) Cu(II) and V(IV) molecular qubit candidates.",

The slopes and coefficients for CuPc are increased further relative to the other Cu(II) complexes, as the Cu-N bonds are significantly more ionic than the Cu-S bonds of Cu(mnt)\\({}_{2}\\), Cu(bdt)\\({}_{2}\\) and Cu(bds)\\({}_{2}\\).",

As shown in Sessoli et al.[13, 53], six coordinate V(IV) complexes do not exhibit long \\(T_{I}\\)s at elevated temperatures. Very recently, Albino et al.[13] pointed to the role of increased excited state SOC in six coordinate complexes relative to vandyl complexes. Furthermore, Fataftah et al.[33] compared six coordinate V(IV) complexes to Cu(II) complexes to suggest the role of increased covalency in elongating \\(T_{I}\\) relaxation lifetimes. Here we have extended our LFT model to the V(bdt)\\({}_{3}\\) and V(bds)\\({}_{3}\\) complexes studied by Fataftah et al.[33] (Table 6). Interestingly, as pointed out by Albino et al.[13] for other six coordinate V(IV) complexes, the V(bdt)\\({}_{3}\\) and V(bds)\\({}_{3}\\) complexes exhibit very low energy calculated ligand field transitions (7935 and 6785 cm-1, respectively). Furthermore, the totally symmetric stretches of these complexes were computed at 351.7 and 209.8 cm-1, respectively. These modes allow for a quantitative comparison between the linear spin-phonon coupling term of Cu(II) complexes on a A-1 scale. The linear coupling terms for V(bds)\\({}_{6}\\) in the g\\({}_{\\parallel}\\) and g\\({}_{\\perp}\\) regions are -0.420 and -0.357 g/A, respectively. For comparison, the linear coupling term of the totally symmetric \\(a_{lg}\\) parent mode of Cu(bdt)\\({}_{2}\\) is smaller (0.232 g/A). Also, the calculated vibrational frequency decreases and the linear coupling terms increase going from V(bdt)\\({}_{3}\\) to V(bds)\\({}_{3}\\). Thus, the longer spin-lattice relaxation time at higher temperatures for Cu(bdt)\\({}_{2}\\) vs. V(bdt)\\({}_{3}\\) is not due to differences in ligand-metal covalency, but rather stems from efficient excited state SOC as a result of the relatively low energy ligand field transition energies for V(bdt)\\({}_{3}\\). This is further supported by the observation of room temperature coherence in vandylcomplexes,[37] despite ionic ligand metal bonding. Together, these DFT/TDDFT calculations are consistent with the LFT model derived here and further highlight the importance of considering both excited state SOC and ligand-metal covalency when comparing different complexes with different metals and/or coordination environments.",

They also found that the amount of energy in the atoms connected to V(IV), the atoms connected to V(IV), and the vibrations of the atoms connected to V(IV) were different between vandyl and the complex of six coordinate V(IV). The higher energy in the V(dtb) complex resulted in a slower relaxation time than the one in the V(bds) complex. They also found that this is not due to how the atoms are connected to the atoms, but because the energy of the V(bds) complex is lower than the energy of the V(dtb) complex. Even though the atoms connected to the V(bdz) complex are connected by a different way of metal bonding, the researchers found that there is a long coherence time at room temperature."

The entic/rack state and ligand field strain is therefore of relevance to molecular qubits. For example, Cu(II)-based complexes with the longest coherence times are square planar Cu(II) sites stabilized in diamagnetic lattices (e.g., Cu(mnt)\\({}_{2}\\)[50] and Cu(bdt)\\({}_{2}\\)[33]). The geometric dependence to \\(T_{I}\\) was also noted in an EPR study of a variety of Cu(II) complexes.[69] Here we have shown that the origin of this dependence for the square planar Cu(II) geometry derives from the significant minimization of excited state coupling terms, which reduces dynamic SOC of orbital angular momentum into the ground state (Figure 4).",

This can give us special things called \"property\". This \"nematic/rack state\" and special placement are important for a special computer-like thing called \"molecular qubits\". Some copper-based complexes with the longest times are found in diamagnetic lattices and when an extra thing called \"dynamic spin-orbit coupling\" happens less often. We figured out that the reason for this special placement of copper-based complexes happens because the special \"excitement\" that happens within the complex when electrons move happens less often, and this makes the dynamic \"spin-orbit coupling\" less likely."

For instance, as noted above, distortion along this mode will decrease the energy for the square planar Cu(II) complexes studied here, which results in the \\(b_{2u}\\) mode being imaginary. However, this is not the case for CuPc. Thus, linking the four N-based ligands into the aromatic planar structure of the Pc ligand provides an entictic state that can oppose distortions along the \\(b_{2u}\\) parent mode.

To prevent the copper(II) from being put together differently, scientists put together a special kind of ligand called Pc in the copper(II) compound. But, this kind of ligand also makes the copper(II) bonds more ionic, which means the copper(II) is more charged. This can compete with the effects of the ligand field, which is a structure that restrains the ligand molecules around the copper(II) so that they don't move freely."

Factors 1) and 3) are directly related, as covalency further reduces the SOC constant of a metal in a complex relative to that of the free ion. LFT expressions derived here predict spin-phonon coupling terms in both odd and even modes are important to consider for decoherence times (equation 5). However, odd modes such as the totally symmetric stretch play a key role for decoherence times. We have further shown how the LFT expressions and thus spin-phonon coupling terms (equations 6 and 7) can be directly related to spectroscopic observables and calculable quantities. For Cu(II), key geometric and symmetry factors, including ligand field strain, significantly lower excited state coupling terms while simultaneously increasing orbital overlap and ligand-metal covalency.

When focusing on the lengths of [n]carbholeicenes, it is assumed that the overlap of the n-planes becomes more significant by forming a layered structure; double layered at n = 7 and triple layered at n = 13. In 2015, [16]carbobielcene (A) was synthesized by Murase and Fujita, and this is the longest [n]carbobielcene ever synthesized (Figure 1).[5] The synthesis of longer helicenes has been desired simply as a synthetic challenge and various improved synthetic methods have been devised.[1-6] Helicenes comprising more than triple-layered structures are particularly difficult to synthesize, because of solubility issues, and because the middle-layered core is tightly compressed, making it difficult to release the strain. Recently, several longer helicene analogues that can release the strain by virtue of their structure have been developed. For example, expanded helicenes, in which phenanthrene units are partially replaced by anthracine units to increase the diameter of helicenes,[6] and perylene bisimide-incorporated helicenes (helicene nanoribbons) have been synthesized.[7] These \"diameter-expanded\" helicene analogues display interesting dynamic behavior and chiroptical properties. Tilly's group synthesized expanded [n]helicenes (B) with three different lengths (n = 15, 19, 23), and compared the racemization barriers and dissymmetry factors.[8] By contrast, Hirose and Matsuda have reported \"n-extended\" [n]carbobielcenes (C) with three different lengths (n = 5, 7, 9), and compared their chiroptical properties, aromaticity, and ultrafast dynamics in the excited state.[9] As another type of helicene analog, heterobielcenes, in which heteroatoms are embedded into the helicene backbones, have also attracted attention because of their excellent luminescence and redox properties.[10; 11] Generally, heterohelicenes are more electron-rich compared with carbobielcenes, thus their HOMO energy levels are continuously destabilized with the n-extension. Therefore, it is more difficult to synthesize longer heterohelicenes with full conjugation, whereas several heterohelicenes with a double-layered structure have been synthesized; one example is diazatri-oxa-[13]helicene D.[12] Furthermore, a triple-layered structure was accomplished with oxa[n]helicene E (n = 17, 19) albeit with disrupted n-conjugation.[13] To qualitatively evaluate the electronic properties of helicenes, however, it is necessary to systematically synthesize fully conjugated heterohelicenes of different lengths, therefore, a synthetic strategy toward longer heterohelicene would be indispensable.

The interplanar angles are 16.3\\({}^{\\circ}\\), 11.6\\({}^{\\circ}\\), and 20.4\\({}^{\\circ}\\), being smaller than that of [9]AH in accordance with the effective interlayer \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions. The crystal structures of [13]AH and [15]AH are also shown in Figure 2A. As the space group is _P3\\({}_{2}\\)_ for the former and the lattice contains only one enantiomer, spontaneous chiral resolution took place for [13]AH upon crystallization. Chiral separation using HPLC apparatus is discussed later. In [13]AH and [15]AH, the shortest interplanar distances are less than 3.2 A (3.199 A and 3.176 A), and the aromatic rings are very closely packed together, again confirming the existence of effective \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions. The smallest interplanar angles are 3.3\\({}^{\\circ}\\) and 1.4\\({}^{\\circ}\\) for [13]AH and [15]AH, respectively. These values are even smaller than those of [11]AH. The crystal structures of [17]AH and [19]AH are the first examples of triple-layered fully conjugated heterobilenes. In both [17]AH and [19]AH, the shortest interplanar distances are also less than 3.2 A (3.170 A and 3.185 A, respectively), and the smallest interplanar angles are the smallest of those measured (1.2\\({}^{\\circ}\\) and 0.8\\({}^{\\circ}\\)). The interplanar angles at the ends are larger than those of the helicene central core due to the effect of electron repulsion and smaller steric constraints ([19]AH; \\(\\theta_{\\rm{A}}\\) = 19.5\\({}^{\\circ}\\), \\(\\theta_{\\rm{BN}}\\) = 0.81\\({}^{\\circ}\\)). However, at the center of the helicene core, the angles are almost 0\\({}^{\\circ}\\), because the central layers of [17]AH and [19]AH are located under large steric constraints from the top and bottom layers. After six types of crystal structures were obtained, their structural parameters of them (interplanar distance, interplanar angle, and dihedral angle) were compared with those of the obtained structures calculated at the B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-SVP level (Fig 2B).[21, 22] For all the parameters, the trend of the experimentally determined values agreed with those obtained from the theoretical calculations, which reproduced the notable changes from [9]AH to [11]AH. This result reflects the weak intramolecular \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions at the terminal aromatic ring of helicenes. A decrease in the interplanar distances or angles results in an increase in the dihedral angles, indicating that the intramolecular interactions become stronger and the aromatic rings become more densely stacked with helicene elongation, while the strain energies of the [n]AHs increase with helicene elongation. To estimate the inherent strain energy of [n]AHs, we attempted to adopt a homodesmotic reaction model.[23] Accordingly, the strain energy (_AH_) of [n]AHs increased continuously as the number _n'_ increased (Figure S7-12). These estimations are in accordance with several cases of expanded helicenes previously reported.[60] Finally, the interlayer \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions of [n]AHs between the two neighboring layers were visualized using the noncovalent interaction (NCI) plot analysis (Figures 2A and S7-11).[24] Dispersion interactions between the two stacked layers of [n]AHs are obvious (green surface shows intramolecular \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions). In particular, intramolecular \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions across three layers was confirmed for [17]AH and [19]AH.",

The longer [n]AHs exhibited negative potentials at -0.06 V for [11]AH, -0.16 V for [13]AH, -0.26 V for [15]AH, -0.38 V for [17]AH, and -0.48 V for [19]AH. The negative shift in the first oxidation potentials can be attributed to an increase in the number of electron-rich pyrrole units in the helicene core. In particular, [19]AH was confirmed to be very easily oxidized. Nevertheless, the as-synthesized [19]AH was purified using flash chromatography on silica at room temperature and recrystallized from THF/_n_-hexane, allowing the growth of single crystals under ambient conditions (_vide supra_). Molecular orbital calculations were performed for the optimized structures of [n]AH in the ground state (Figure 4). The HOMO energy level gradually increased as the helical length increased. By contrast, the LUMO energy level was not markedly affected by the elongation, resulting in a gradual decrease in the HOMO-LUMO gaps. To gain further insight into the structure-property relationship in these benzannulated aza[n] helicenes without benzannulated structures (_i.e._, [n]AH) were also calculated (Figure S7-8).[25] The HOMO energy levels of [n]AH's are generally higher than those of [n]AHs by 0.11-0.37 eV (_e.g._ -4.45 V for [19]AH vs -4.18 V for [19]AH).

One such approach is to use atomization energy corrections (AECs) followed by bond additivity corrections (BACs), such as those defined by Petersson et al. or Anantharaman and Melius. Another approach is to utilize isodesemic reactions (IDRs) which are error-canceling reactions that can be constructed systematically as shown by Buerger et al.

As part of this work, we curate a diverse database of over 400 reference species from the available literature for use in fitting BACs or to participate in IDRs, and also provide AECs and BACs for 15 commonly used levels of theory using the workflow implemented. When comparing the approaches, we find that both BAC types yield results of similar accuracy, though the Anantharaman and Melius-type BACs seem to generalize better. Further, although the IDRs approach is often as accurate as the BAC approaches and sometimes even more advantageous, we find that this method appears to be less robust than the BAC methods. In particular, the accuracy of the IDRs approach is sensitive to the chosen reference species and reactions. Therefore, in addition to providing the automated AECs and BACs fitting procedure, we also propose improved methods to select IDRs.",

Experiments can provide high-accuracy results, often yielding data accuracy within 0.1 kcal/mol or better. However, usually several experiments need to be combined to obtain accurate thermochemical parameters reported in standard states. Moreover, many species (especially radicals, but not exclusively) cannot be isolated conveniently for experimentation. Due to the importance of these parameters, several databases exist that provide high-accuracy thermochemistry data. One widely used database is the Active Thermochemical Table (ATcT)[1, 2], which aims to produce a self-consistent set of species thermochemistry with continually improving accuracy. When data from ATcT or other high-quality experimental sources are available, they represent the preferred route for obtaining the most accurate thermochemical values of a species of interest. However, entries in ATcT represent only a minuscule fraction of all species of interest in the vast chemical universe. Given that experiments are often time-consuming, particularly if they require synthesizing the species of interest, computing species thermochemistry through quantum mechanical (QM) calculations can prove quite valuable.",

That's why some databases help scientists find the accurate measurements for these species. One of the databases is called Active Thermochemical Table (ATcT). When scientists use the measurements from the database or experiments, they find the most accurate measurements of a species.

However, to realize the accuracy gains, it is well-known that energy corrections are needed in addition to the QM calculations to reduce residual errors present from the given level of theory (LOT).

As we show later in this work, if no additional corrections are used, the resulting \\(\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{f}}\\) tends to have a fairly wide distribution of errors, often not centered around zero.

Recently, delta machine learning (\\(\\Delta\\)-ML) techniques have been applied to this type of problem [6]. However, while ML methods have gained popularity, they often lack the interpretability intrinsic to classic strategies. In this study, our emphasis will be placed on two conventional methods. The first approach involves the use of bond additivity corrections (BACs). BAC methods assume that the residual error from QM calculations can be attributed to errors associated with specific types of bonds within a molecule. Further, the errors associated with a particular type of bond (e.g., a C-C single bond) are assumed to be largely consistent across various molecules that contain the same bond type. Therefore, a correction value can be fitted for each bond type found in a collection of reference molecules, and the total bond additivity correction is simply the sum of these corrections for every bond in a species of interest. In this work, we focus on two popular implementations of BAC: those of Petersson et al. [7] and those of Anantharaman and Melius [8]. For brevity, below we call the Anantharaman & Melius' BAC's \"Melius-type\" or \"m-BAC\", although we note that Melius had success with several different types of BACs during his long career [9].

If the reaction under consideration was an isodesmic reaction with respect to these atom and bond types, then these systematic errors exactly cancel. However, since we have excluded the target species from the summation in Equation (5d), the atom and bond types present in the target molecule have not cancelled. In this way, the summation in Equation (5d) can be viewed as calculating corrections similar to AECs and BACs for the chemical features (e.g., atom type, bond type, rings, charge, multiplicity, etc.) present in the target molecule and then applying these corrections. Consequently, if someone constructs isodesmic reactions by considering the bond types of Petersson et al., then the IDR scheme is mathematically equivalent to applying Petersson-type BACs, albeit with a much smaller training set since usually only a few species are selected to build IDRs.",

One disadvantage is that if a reference species included in the isodesmic reaction has a large uncharacteristic error, this error will affect the final result much more than if a larger reference set was used for training. One way to mitigate this error sensitivity issue is to take an average or median of values obtained from multiple isodesmic reactions. Another method to allow better error cancellation is to choose species that are chemically similar to the target when building IDRs. Finally, constraints could be placed on the species of an isodesmic reaction to ensure that the bonds present in the reaction are similar in nature to each other, and thus should have similar cancellation of errors.

The coordination number for the atoms connected by the bond is then used to define a bond feature that separates different types of bonds. Take single C-C bond of ethane as an example, where the carbon atoms on two sides of this bond both have a coordination number of 3 (notice that by convention the carbon-carbon bond in question is excluded from the calculation of coordination number). However, for the single C-C bond in propylene, the \\(sp^{3}\\) carbon atom has a coordination number of 3 but the other \\(sp^{2}\\) carbon atom only has a coordination number of 2. Therefore, the C-C single bond of ethane and propylene are treated as different bond types.

Like when you play cards, you have a good pile of cards or a bad pile. Each card has a number, and the numbers have to match to win. So, in RC3, you have to know if the atoms have the same number or not to decide if they are the same type of bond.\n\nRC4 is even deeper, it not only needs to know the atoms connected by the bond are the same type, it also needs to know if other atoms next to them are the same.

This result suggests that Melius-type BACs might generalize better to types of molecules that are not well represented in the reference set, and that Petersson-type BACs are more likely to be undermined by over-fitting, for p-BACs fit a single parameter to a fairly broad notion of a bond type (e.g., treating C-C bonds in benzene and ethane as the same). In unfortunate scenarios, it is therefore possible that Petersson-type BACs are fitted on a training set containing, for example, C-C bonds with substantial chemical differences from the C-C bond in target species, leading to poor performance in real-life tests and applications. Melius-type BACs on the other hand are inherently more flexible in distinguishing between bond types, though a diverse training set is still crucial.",

For instance, one aspect that is worth considering is the data quality of the species included in the isodesmic reaction since some species in the reference set might have a poor geometry at the given level of theory.

            "output_text": "To get the right answer about how much energy is released or absorbed when a medicine is made, we recommend using a special kind of information called a Melius-type BAC. But sometimes, this might not be very important and we can still use another kind called Petersson-type BAC. We also have something called isodesmic reactions that can be used, just like Melius-type BAC, but it's important to choose good options carefully. It's important to compare these options and see which one works best. It could help us learn more about how to make the right choice for different situations. Just like different types of food can affect your body differently, different LOTs can affect how much energy is released or absorbed differently. To know which one is the best, we need to check and see which one works the best and which one doesn't. This will help us make the right choices and make progress in studying different kinds of molecules."
