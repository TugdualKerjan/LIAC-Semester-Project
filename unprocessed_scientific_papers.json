[{"article": "the interest in anchoring phenomena and phenomena in confined nematic liquid crystals has largely been driven by their potential use in liquid crystal display devices .\nthe twisted nematic liquid crystal cell serves as an example .\nit consists of a nematic liquid crystal confined between two parallel walls , both providing homogeneous planar anchoring but with mutually perpendicular easy directions . in this case\nthe orientation of the nematic director is tuned by the application of an external electric or magnetic field .\na precise control of the surface alignment extending over large areas is decisive for the functioning of such devices .\nmost studies have focused on nematic liquid crystals in contact with laterally uniform substrates . on the other hand substrate inhomogeneities\narise rather naturally as a result of surface treatments such as rubbing .\nthus the nematic texture near the surface is in fact non - uniform .\nthis non - uniformity , however , is smeared out beyond a decay length proportional to the periodicity of the surface pattern .\nvery often the thickness of the non - uniform surface layer is considerably smaller than both the wavelength of visible light and the thickness of the nematic cell , i.e. , the distance between the two confining parallel walls\n. hence optical properties of the nematic liquid crystal confined between such substrates correspond to those resulting from effective , uniform substrates .\nmore recent developments have demonstrated that surfaces patterned with a large periodicity of some micrometers are of considerable interest from a technological point of view ( see , e.g. , ref .\n@xcite and references therein ) .\na new generation of electro - optical devices relies on nematic liquid crystals with patterned orientation of the nematic director over small areas which can be achieved by chemically patterning the confining surfaces .\nfor example , to produce flat - panel displays with wide viewing angles one can use pixels that are divided into sub - pixels , where each sub - pixel is defined by a different orientation of the nematic director , which is induced by the surface structure and subsequently tuned by the electric field .\nin addition to the technological relevance , nematic liquid crystals in contact with non - uniform substrates provide the opportunity to study basic phenomena such as effective elastic forces between the substrates and phase transitions between various competing nematic textures ( see , e.g. , ref .\n@xcite and references therein ) .    whereas the influence of homogeneous confining substrates on nematic liquid crystals is now well understood ,\nthe phase behavior of nematic liquid crystals in contact with chemically or geometrically patterned substrates is still debated .\none might suppose that theoretical calculations based on continuum theories should resolve the properties of nematic liquid crystals in contact with patterned substrates @xcite .\nhowever , such calculations are numerically demanding because two- or three - dimensional grids have to be used because of the broken symmetry due to the surface pattern .\nmoreover , it is very challenging to determine metastable states and energy barriers between them which are important for the understanding of bistable nematic devices @xcite . in the present paper\nwe adopt a different strategy which takes the advantage of the finite decay length characterizing the influence of the surface pattern on the nematic liquid crystal in the direction perpendicular to the substrate .\nwe determine first an anchoring energy function and an average surface director orientation of the patterned substrate and obtain an effective free energy for the nematic liquid crystal cell under consideration .\nwe find remarkably good agreement between the phase diagrams of various systems calculated using this effective free energy function on the one hand and the original free energy functional on the other hand .\nthe continuum theory for liquid crystals has its origin dating back to at least the work of oseen @xcite and zocher @xcite .\nthis early version of the continuum theory for nematic liquid crystals played an important role for the further development of the static theory and its more direct formulation by frank @xcite .\nthe frank theory is formulated in terms of the so - called nematic director @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and its possible spatial distortions .\nthe nematic director describes the direction of the locally averaged molecular alignment in liquid crystals . in a nematic liquid crystal\nthe centers of mass of the liquid crystal molecules do not exhibit long - ranged order .\nthe molecules can translate freely while being aligned , on average , parallel to one another and to the nematic director .\nit is known that if an initially uniform nematic liquid crystal is distorted by external forces , it relaxes back to the uniform state after the disturbing influence is switched off , signaling that the uniform configuration represents a thermodynamically stable state .\ntherefore it is assumed that there is a cost in free energy associated with elastic distortions of the nematic director of the form @xmath2&=&\\frac{1}{2}\\int_v\nd^3 r\\,\\left[k_{11}\\left(\\nabla\\cdot\\hat{{\\bf n}}\\right)^2\\right.\\nonumber \\\\&+&\\!\\!\\!\\left.k_{22}(\\hat{{\\bf n}}\\cdot(\\nabla \\times\\hat{{\\bf n}}))^2 + k_{33}(\\hat{{\\bf n}}\\times(\\nabla \\times \\hat{{\\bf n}}))^2\\right],\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\label{eq1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the volume accessible to the nematic liquid crystal and @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are elastic constants associated with splay , twist , and bend distortions , respectively .\nthe elastic constants depend on temperature and are commonly of the order @xmath7 to . sometimes , for example , when the relative values of the elastic constants are unknown or when the resulting euler - lagrange equations are complicated , the one - constant approximation @xmath8 is made . in this case\nthe elastic free energy functional reduces to @xmath9&=&\\frac{k}{2}\\int_v d^3 r\\,\\left(\\nabla\\hat{{\\bf n}}\\right)^2\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the presence of surfaces the bulk free energy @xmath10 must be supplemented by the surface free energy @xmath11 such that the total free energy is given by @xmath12 . in the corresponding equilibrium euler - lagrange equations @xmath13 , @xmath11 leads to appropriate boundary conditions .\nthe description of the nematic director alignment at the surfaces forming the boundaries is called anchoring .\nin addition to the so - called free boundary condition where there is no anchoring , one considers weak and strong anchoring . if there are no anchoring conditions imposed on @xmath14 at the boundary , the bulk free energy @xmath15 is minimized using standard techniques of the calculus of variations . in the case of strong anchoring it\nis also sufficient to minimize the bulk free energy but subject to @xmath14 taking prescribed fixed values at the boundary . in the case of weak\nanchoring the total free energy @xmath16 , which includes the surface free energy @xmath11 , has to be minimized .\nthe most commonly used expression for the surface free energy is of the form proposed by rapini and papoular by @xcite : @xmath17=\\frac{1}{2}\\int_{s } d^2 r\\,w({\\bf r } ) ( \\hat{{\\bf n}}\\cdot{\\nu})^2.\\ ] ] the integral runs over the boundary and @xmath18 is the corresponding anchoring strength that characterizes the surface .\nthe local unit vector perpendicular to the surface is denoted as @xmath14 . for negative @xmath19\n, this contribution favors an orientation of the molecules perpendicular to the surface , while positive @xmath19 favor degenerate planar orientations at the surface .\nthe absolute value of the anchoring strength is commonly of the order @xmath20 to .\nhere we consider a nematic liquid crystal confined between a patterned substrate at @xmath21 and a flat substrate at @xmath22 where the @xmath23 axis is normal to the flat substrate . as figs .\n[ fig1 ] ( a ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) illustrate , the lower substrate is characterized by geometrical and/or chemical patterns of periodicity @xmath24 along the @xmath25 axis . moreover , the system is translationally invariant in the @xmath26 direction . within the one -

( [ eq6 ] ) ] . in this subsection\nwe apply this approach to the particular case of a nematic liquid crystal confined between a chemically patterned sinusoidal surface and a flat substrate with strong homeotropic anchoring ( see fig .\n[ fig1 ]  ( a ) ) . the surface profile of the grating surface\nis given by @xmath65 , where @xmath34 is the groove depth and @xmath66 is the period .\nas figure [ fig1 ] ( a ) illustrates , the surface exhibits a pattern consisting of alternating stripes with locally homeotropic and homogeneous planar anchoring .\nthe projection of the widths of the stripes onto the @xmath25 axis is @xmath67 and the anchoring strength is specified by a periodic step function : @xmath68 and @xmath69 for values of @xmath25 on the homeotropic and planar stripes , respectively .\nfigure [ fig2 ] ( a ) displays @xmath70 ( dashed line ) and @xmath71 ( solid line ) for @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 . the shapes of @xmath70 as a function of @xmath48 and @xmath71 as a function of @xmath42 are rather similar because @xmath75 ( see eq .\n( [ eq8 ] ) ) for this set of model parameters .\nfigure [ fig2 ] ( b ) displays the phase diagram plotted as a function of the anchoring angle @xmath40 at the upper substrate and the mean separation of the substrates @xmath35 .\nthe calculations demonstrate the existence of two ( stable or metastable ) nematic director configurations : the homeotropic ( h ) phase , in which the director field is almost uniform and parallel to the anchoring direction imposed at the upper surface , i.e. , @xmath76 , and the hybrid aligned nematic ( han ) phase , in which the director field varies from @xmath77 at the upper surface to nearly planar orientation through the cell .\nnote that there are two han textures : han@xmath78 and han@xmath79 corresponding to positive and negative average surface angles at the lower surface ( see also fig .  [\nfig : diagram ] below ) . for small anchoring angles @xmath40 the han phases\nare stable provided the cell width is larger than @xmath80 ( more precisely , the han@xmath78 texture is stable for @xmath81 while the han@xmath79 texture is stable for @xmath82 and they coexist at @xmath83 ) . for smaller distances between the substrates\n@xmath84 the han phases are no longer stable because distortions of the director field are too costly in the presence of the dominating strong anchoring at the upper surface . the comparison of the phase boundary of thermal equilibrium as obtained from the effective free energy method [ eqs .\n( [ eq6 ] ) - ( [ eq8 ] ) , and solid line in fig .  [ fig2 ]  ( b ) ] and the direct minimization of the underlying free energy functional [ eqs .\n( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) , and diamonds in fig .

( [ eq7 ] ) ] because the condition for this inversion is not satisfied [ eq .  ( [ eq9 ] ) ] . to this end\nwe have chosen the parameters @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath74 for the system shown in fig .\n[ fig1 ]  ( a ) .\nfigure [ fig3 ] ( a ) display ( dashed line ) and ( solid line ) while the corresponding phase diagram is shown in fig .\n[ fig3 ]  ( b ) . as is apparent from the solid line in fig .\n[ fig3 ]  ( a ) it is not possible to determine the effective surface free energy function for the all values of @xmath42 because the upper flat substrate at @xmath36 is too far away from the lower patterned substrate in order to induce all possible average anchoring orientations @xmath42 . in other words , the anchoring energy at the patterned substrate is too large to be balanced by the elastic energy for the chosen mean distance @xmath36 between the substrates ( see fig .\n[ fig1 ]  ( b ) ) . nevertheless fig .\n[ fig3 ]  ( b ) demonstrates that even this partial information about the effective surface free energy function can be used to calculate the phase diagram for cell widths sufficiently larger than the width at the critical point @xmath120 .      in the last subsection we have shown that with a suitable chemical and geometrical surface morphology on one of the interior surfaces of a liquid crystal cell\n, two stable nematic director configurations can be supported .\nthe zenithally bistable nematic devices that have been studied recently @xcite consist of a nematic liquid crystal confined between a chemically homogeneous grating surface ( see fig .\n[ fig1 ]  ( c ) ) and a flat substrate with strong homeotropic anchoring .\nthe profile of the asymmetric surface grating is given by @xmath121 where @xmath34 is the groove depth , @xmath66 the period , and @xmath122 is the `` blazing '' parameter describing the asymmetry of the surface profile\n. such a grating surface has been studied by brown _\n@xcite who found a first order transition between the han state , characterized by a low pretilt angle ( @xmath123 ) , and the h state , characterized by a high pretilt angle ( @xmath124 ) . strictly speaking\n, the h state does not correspond to the homeotropic texture ( see fig .\n[ fig5 ]  ( b ) below ) , but we keep the same notation as in the previous section for consistency . here\nwe study phase transitions of a nematic liquid crystal in contact with the blazed surface in a more detail using the effective free energy method discussed in sec .\nii  c.    in fig .\n[ fig : blazed ]  ( a ) the minimized free energy @xmath70 ( dashed line ) and the calculated effective surface free energy @xmath71 ( solid line ) are shown for the anchoring strength @xmath125 on the grating surface , the groove depth @xmath126 , and the blazing parameter @xmath127 .\nthe effective surface free energy is asymmetric with respect to @xmath128 because of the asymmetry of the grating surface . as a consequence\nalso the phase diagram , plotted as a function of the anchoring angle on the upper surface @xmath40 and the distance @xmath129 is asymmetric ( fig .  [\nfig : blazed ]  ( b ) ) .\nhowever , the topology of the phase diagram is the same as in the case of a symmetric substrate ( see figs .\n[ fig2 ] ( b ) , [ fig3 ] ( b ) , and for a more general discussion sec .\niii  c below ) .\n( c ) and eq .\n( [ eq : blazed ] ) ) .\nthe locally homeotropic anchoring strength on the blazed surface is @xmath130 , the groove depth is @xmath131 and the blazing parameter is @xmath127 .\n@xmath28 is the extension of the cell in the invariant @xmath26 direction and @xmath85 is the isotropic elastic constant .\nthe effective surface free energy ( as well as ) is periodic with the period @xmath132 but it is asymmetric with respect to @xmath133 .\n( b ) phase diagram of the same system as a function of the anchoring angle at the upper flat substrate @xmath40 and the cell width @xmath35 with the same line code as in figs .\n[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] .\nthe triple point ( where the han@xmath78 , han@xmath79 and h phases coexist ) is at @xmath134 and @xmath135 , and the critical points ( solid circle ) are at @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 , @xmath139\n. for clearness , only the limits of metastability of the han@xmath79 ( 1 ) phase and the h ( 2 ) phase ( for negative @xmath40 ) are shown.,width=302 ]    ( c ) and eq .\n( [ eq : blazed ] ) ) with local homeotropic anchoring and a flat surface with strong homeotropic anchoring ( @xmath98 ) as a function of the groove depth @xmath140 and the cell width @xmath129 .\nthe anchoring strength on the blazed surface is @xmath130 .\nthe lines correspond to different values of @xmath122 and denote first order transitions between homeotropic ( h ) and hybrid aligned ( han@xmath79 ) phases . for small @xmath140 , the lines extend to @xmath141 corresponding to a first order _ anchoring _ transition between planar and homeotropic phases . upon increasing\n@xmath140 the first order transition lines end at critical points which are not shown in the figure .\n( b ) the energy barrier at the first order transitions with the same line code as in ( a ) .\nthe lines have been obtained from the total effective free energy ( see eq .\n( [ eq6 ] ) ) , while the diamonds correspond to the energy barriers between the planar and homeotropic effective anchoring which follow from considering only the surface contribution @xmath44.,width=302 ]    ) ) for the hybrid aligned ( han@xmath79 ) phase in ( a ) and the homeotropic ( h ) phase in ( b ) on the lines of the first order transitions ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) for a nematic liquid crystal confined between the blazed surface ( see fig .  [ fig1 ]  ( c ) and eq .\n( [ eq : blazed ] ) ) with local homeotropic anchoring and a flat surface with strong homeotropic anchoring ( @xmath98 ) .\nthe diamonds in ( a ) and ( b ) correspond to the two minima of the effective surface energy function @xmath142 .\nthe model parameters and the line code are the same as in fig .\n, width=302 ]    we now concentrate on the most interesting ( from a practical point of view ) case of strong homeotropic anchoring ( @xmath86 ) at the upper homogeneous surface .\nfigure [ fig4 ] ( a ) displays the phase diagram for a few values of the blazing parameter @xmath122 and a fixed value of the local homeotropic anchoring strength on the grating surface @xmath130 . for a fixed cell width @xmath129 , asymmetry ( @xmath143 ) leads to a decrease of the groove depth @xmath140 at which there is a first order transition between the han and the h phases , as compared to the nematic liquid crystal cell with the symmetric surface grating ( @xmath144 ) . upon increasing the groove depth\n@xmath140 the transition line ends at a critical point ( not shown in the figure ) , while it diverges as @xmath145 .\nthe groove depth @xmath146 corresponds to an _ anchoring _ ( or surface ) transition between low tilt and high tilt _ surface _\nstates which are the homeotropic and planar effective anchoring states , respectively , in the case @xmath144 .\nthe effective free energy method allows one to calculate an energy barrier @xmath147 between the two bistable states , which is _ not _\nfeasible by the direct numerical minimization of the free energy functional .\nthe results of our calculations are shown in fig .\n[ fig4 ]  ( b ) .\nthe asymmetry of the surface grating leads to a decrease of the energy barrier . with increasing groove depth @xmath140 the energy barrier decreases and eventually vanishes upon approaching the critical point .\nthe diamonds in fig .\n[ fig4 ]  ( b ) denote the energy barriers for the abovementioned anchoring transitions of a nematic liquid crystal in contact with a single grating surface .\nthe energy barrier between two bistable states is an important quantity for the design of a zenithally bistable nematic device .\ntoo small energy barrier , as compared to @xmath148 , would cause spontaneous switching between the two states because of thermal fluctuations , while enlarging the energy barrier leads to an increase of the power consumption . using the calculated values of @xmath147 ( see fig .\n[ fig4 ]  ( b ) ) one can estimate the energy barrier in a real nematic liquid crystal cell .\nfor instance , for a cell of area @xmath149 and of width @xmath150 , and taking the typical values @xmath151 and @xmath152 , one obtains @xmath153 for @xmath154 and @xmath155 , which seems to be an acceptable value .\nanother important quantity in zenithally bistable nematic devices is the average director orientation at the grating surface in the two degenerate states .\nthe average surface director in the han ( @xmath156 ) and h ( @xmath157 ) states is shown in fig .\n[ fig5 ] for the same model parameters as in fig .\n[ fig4 ] and for the values of @xmath140 and @xmath129 corresponding to the coexistence line .\nthe asymmetry of the surface grating leads to a decrease of @xmath156 and an increase of @xmath158 . for a fixed value of @xmath122\n, the difference between the two angles decreases with increasing the groove depth @xmath140 and finally vanishes upon approaching the critical point ( not shown in the figure ) .\nhence the asymmetry of the surface grating leads to a decrease of the groove depth at which the bistability is observed , which improves optical properties @xcite , and to a decrease of the energy barrier , which lowers the power consumption of a zenithally bistable nematic device . on the other hand ,\nalso the difference between the two bistable states decreases which impairs optical properties of such a device .\nin section [ iiia ] we have discussed phase diagrams in the @xmath159 plane which can be described in terms of the surface free energy given by eq .  .\nhowever , it is instructive to consider a more general situation that the

known features of rich galaxy clusters in addition to the tight spatial clustering of cluster galaxies .\nfirst , the bright end of the cluster luminosity function is dominated by red sequence galaxies with a small dispersion in color - magnitude space ( the e / s0 ridgeline ) .\nsecond , clusters contain a distinct brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) located near the center of the galaxy distribution .\nwhile some clusters lack an obvious central , dominant galaxy , every cluster does possess some red sequence galaxy brighter than any other .\nthe algorithm measures independently the likelihood that a galaxy is spatially located in an overdensity of e / s0 ridgeline galaxies with similar @xmath35 and @xmath36 colors , and that it has the color and magnitude properties of a typical bcg .\nboth likelihoods are evaluated for every sdss galaxy at a grid of redshifts .\nthe redshift which maximizes the product of these likelihoods is then found for each galaxy .\nfor e / s0 galaxies , this corresponding maximum likelihood redshift then provides a good estimate of the cluster redshift .\nonce this list of cluster center likelihoods is assembled , these potential centers are ranked by decreasing maximum likelihood . the first cluster is seeded on the highest likelihood center , that cluster s bcg .\ngalaxies projected within a scaled radius , @xmath37 , of this bcg and within @xmath38 in @xmath31 are eliminated from the list of potential centers .\n@xmath37 is the radius interior to which the mean density is 200 times the critical density ( @xmath39 ) as determined from sdss galaxy populations  @xcite .\nthe process is repeated for the next most likely bcg on the list , given that it has not been eliminated by a higher likelihood bcg , and continues likewise until all potential centers have either been labeled as cluster bcgs or have been subsumed by higher likelihood centers .\neach cluster defined in this way has a center defined as the bcg location , an estimated redshift , and a richness , @xmath6 , given by the number of e / s0 ridgeline members falling within @xmath37 of the bcg and brighter than 0.4 @xmath40 .\nthe final cluster catalog contains an array of measured properties , including photometric redshifts , richnesses , optical luminosities , and locations .\nthe public maxbcg catalog contains a total of 13,823 clusters drawn from approximately 7500 square degrees of sky between redshifts of 0.1 and 0.3 , with a median redshift @xmath41 .\nthe center for each cluster is defined as the location of the bcg identified by the algorithm .\nthe richness of the cluster , @xmath6 , ranges between 10 and 188 in the public catalog , and in principle extends down to @xmath42 where the maxbcg selection function is less well - understood . for this study\nwe include some clusters of lower richness , adding an additional 3532 clusters with @xmath43 .\nthis slightly extended catalog allows us to use the same richness bins studied in the analysis of maxbcg galaxy dynamics  ( b07 ) and gravitational lensing  ( s07 , j07 ) .\nredshift estimates for the clusters , produced as part of the cluster finding process , have been shown by comparison to spectroscopic redshifts to be quite accurate , with @xmath11 @xcite .\ncatalog completeness and purity have been studied in some detail in @xcite ; both are quite high .\ncompleteness is estimated to be @xmath44 for clusters with masses greater than @xmath45 , and purity is @xmath44 for clusters with richnesses @xmath46 .    the cluster population in this catalog has been used to derive constraints on cosmology @xcite using cluster counts .\nthe relationship between the maxbcg richness @xmath6 and mass has been studied through galaxy dynamics  ( b07 ) and weak lensing ( s07 , j07 )\n. further work on galaxy populations , mass -

ray flux - limited cluster catalogs . the brightest cluster sample  ( bcs , * ? ? ?\n* ) is a flux - limited sample of the brightest 201 clusters in the northern hemisphere with fluxes @xmath54 .\nthe northern rosat all - sky galaxy cluster survey  ( noras , * ? ? ?\n* ) is a catalog of 378 extended x - ray sources that have been confirmed to be clusters via optical follow - up . due to the broad rosat psf\n, this catalog is only @xmath55 complete at their stated flux limit , @xmath56 , which corresponds to a luminosity @xmath57 at our median redshift @xmath41 . @xcite\nhave performed an initial comparison between noras clusters and maxbcg clusters and have found that the maxbcg detects @xmath58 of noras objects .\nthis is consistent with estimates of the completeness from simulations  @xcite .\nthe _ rosat_-eso flux limited x - ray galaxy cluster survey  ( reflex : * ? ? ?\n* ) is similar to noras in the southern sky , with the same flux limit .\nthis catalog of 447 clusters is over 90% complete due to improvements in rass analysis , although only a small fraction of reflex overlaps the maxbcg survey area .\nthe typical rass exposure time for maxbcg clusters , 400 s , is too short to allow significant detections for individual clusters .\nthe large number of maxbcg clusters , however , allows us to make up for this .\nfor example , there are 7986 clusters with richnesses 9 @xmath59 11 . for these objects ,\nthe total rass exposure time is @xmath60 .\nsuch a large total exposure allows us to measure the mean x - ray emission from these clusters quite precisely .\ndetails of the stacking method are described later in this section , and outlined here .\nwe begin by dividing the clusters into nine richness ( @xmath6 ) bins . to simplify comparison to other maxbcg analyses\n, we use the same richness bins used in measurements of the mean velocity dispersions  ( b07 ) .\nthe number of clusters in each richness bin is shown in table  [ tab : ncluster ] .\ncccccc @xmath61 & 92.85 & 0.21 & 1727 & 55 & 55 + @xmath62 & 58.22 & 0.21 & 1469 & 146 & 140 + @xmath63 & 44.67 & 0.21 & 1317 & 207 & 201 + @xmath64 & 35.74 & 0.21 & 1201 & 356 & 339 + @xmath65 & 28.57 & 0.22 & 1102 & 665 & 633 + @xmath66 & 22.70 & 0.22 & 997 & 1128 & 1060 + @xmath67 & 18.91 & 0.23 & 941 & 1141 & 1099 + @xmath68 & 13.88 & 0.23 & 823 & 5651 &\n5405 + @xmath69 & 9.80 & 0.23 & 727 & 7986 & 7566 + random & & & 7986 & 7529 +    as we do not have x -

ray selected clusters , which has also been seen for other optically - selected catalogs  ( e.g. * ? ? ?\npossible biases introduced by this assumption are discussed in section  [ sec : centering ] .\nevery source and background photon in the stacked analysis is scaled and weighted to the median redshift of the clusters in the catalog , @xmath71 . with these weighted photon maps\nwe construct stacked images in section  [ sec : images ] , radial profiles in section  [ sec : profiles ] , and spectra and luminosities in section  [ sec : spectra ] .\nwe obtain rass photon data and merged exposure maps from the archives available at the high energy astrophysics science archive research center ( heasarc ) .\nthe rass data and exposure maps are distributed in arbitrarily constructed @xmath72 degree fields with significant overlap . nevertheless , since we utilize a large background annulus extending to @xmath73 from the central bcg , a significant fraction ( @xmath74 ) of the maxbcg clusters fall across a field boundary .\nwe have therefore built a tool that extracts all rass photons in a given aperture , from multiple rass fields if necessary , counting only once those photons which appear multiple times in overlap regions .\nafter photon retrieval , the appropriate merged exposure maps ( mex file ) are used to calculate the effective exposure time ( @xmath75 ) at the position of each detected photon .    before stacking\nwe exclude from the list a subset of maxbcg clusters which might bias our x - ray measurements for unphysical reasons .\nno cut on galactic absorption is required , as the sdss observations are restricted to high galactic latitude .\nthe typical equivalent galactic hydrogen column density is a very low : @xmath76  @xcite for the maxbcg clusters , with a maximum of @xmath77 .\nalthough the typical rass exposure time is @xmath78 , there are some fields with significantly less .\nthis makes source and background estimation difficult , while not adding significantly to the signal . for this reason\n, we reject all clusters with less than 200  s mean exposure time .\nthis removes 4% of the total number of clusters , but less than 1% of the net exposure time .\nan important possible source of contamination for stacked cluster measurements is the presence of a few extremely bright foreground sources .\nwe would like to reject regions contaminated by these sources .\nrass images of maxbcg clusters , especially at higher redshift , are often unresolved , making it difficult to remove point sources using extent information , so we proceed as follows .\nwe first identify those rosat bright source catalog ( bsc ) sources in the survey area with count rates higher than that expected for emission from any cluster at redshift beyond 0.1 .\nthis corresponds to a count rate of @xmath79 .\nthere are 179 bsc sources in the maxbcg survey area with rosat soft - band ( 0.1 - 0.5 kev ) or hard - band ( 0.5 - 2.1 kev ) count rates above this limit . of these 179 sources ,\nonly 13 are clusters as identified in the _ rosat _ brightest cluster sample  ( bcs , * ? ? ?\n* ) . of these 13 clusters ,\nonly one of these objects is associated with a maxbcg cluster ( abell 2142 , the richest and one of the nearest clusters in the catalog ) .\nthe other high - flux clusters are at redshifts @xmath80 .\nfurther visual inspection has confirmed that abell 2142 is the only maxbcg cluster associated with one of these extremely bright sources . for the stacking analysis\n, we reject all maxbcg clusters ( except for abell 2142 ) within @xmath81 of any of these bright sources , due to possible contamination from non - cluster photons .\nthis removes only 0.6% of the maxbcg catalog .\nthe virgo cluster is another important foreground source .\nthis nearby , x - ray bright cluster dominates the rass emission over a significant region of sky , thus making it difficult to estimate the x - ray emission from background clusters .\nwe therefore reject all clusters that fall within @xmath82 degrees of m86 or m87 .\nthis is a relatively small effect , removing only 0.1% of the maxbcg clusters .\ntable  [ tab : ncluster ] shows the number of clusters in each richness bin before and after the rejections outlined in this section , as well as the mean richness for each bin .    to stack the x -

ray cluster emission .      to study the effect of the rass psf on the stacked profiles , we test our analysis on bright rosat point sources .\nthese sources were selected from the wga catalog  @xcite , which contains 88,621 well measured point - like sources selected from rosat pspc pointed observations .\nwe take @xmath130 moderately bright ( @xmath131 ) point sources that overlap the sdss dr5 mask .\nthese bright sources are nearby galactic sources as well as agn and quasars at moderate and high redshift , and are also well detected in rass .\neach point source is randomly assigned a redshift drawn from the maxbcg cluster catalog redshift distribution .\nwe note that a nearby unresolved point source is indistinguishable from a distant unresolved point source .\nthe point sources are then stacked in exactly the manner described for clusters above .\nfigure  [ fig : ptsrc ] shows the radial profile of the stacked point sources ( diamonds ) , which is essentially a measure of the rass psf with the radial scaling calculated for the maxbcg cluster redshifts . while this radial profile is much more sharply peaked than that of the stacked clusters , the broad rosat psf scatters significant x - ray emission to distances @xmath132\n( @xmath133 at @xmath134 ) from the center .\nthis psf smearing implies an effective minimum on the @xmath108-model core radius , as well as creating a possible bias in the calculation of the @xmath108 parameter .\nwe note that @xmath135 of the selected wga point sources are within @xmath136 of maxbcg clusters .\nexcluding the point sources that are neighboring these possibly extended x - ray sources does not significantly alter this result .\nthe stacked , projected surface brightness profile may also be affected by our choice of cluster centers .\nthere are several ways in which the bcg chosen by the maxbcg algorithm might be offset from the x - ray emission from the cluster .\ndynamically active clusters and clusters in the process of merging can have a significant offset between the x - ray centroid and the bcg .\nthere is also the possibility that the maxbcg algorithm chose an incorrect center ( this is addressed more fully in section  [ sec : centering ] ) .\nin addition , there may be additional x - ray point sources such as agn that are associated with the clusters .\nall of these effects result in an effective optical / x - ray offset distribution that may bias the radial profiles .\nwe model the optical / x - ray offset distribution by matching the maxbcg catalog to known x - ray sources . for this exercise ,\nwe use the fact that many maxbcg clusters ( @xmath137 ) are associated with individual detections in the rosat bright source and faint source catalogs .\nmost of these bsc and fsc sources have not been previously recognized as associated with clusters , primarily because they are too faint or too distant to be seen as significantly extended in rass .\nwe match the maxbcg clusters to the bsc and fsc catalogs , allowing multiple x - ray sources to match to each cluster .\nthis ensures that we find all x - ray sources associated with each cluster , as well as all possible random matches .\nwe similarly match an equal number of random locations drawn from the maxbcg survey region to the bsc and fsc catalogs .\nfigure  [ fig : ptmatchhist ] shows the projected offset distribution from the maxbcg clusters to the bsc and fsc catalogs .\nthe solid ( dashed ) line shows a histogram of maxbcg ( random ) offsets in @xmath103 bins .\nthe dotted line shows the residual distribution after subtracting the random matches from the cluster matches .\nthe subtracted histogram in figure  [ fig : ptmatchhist ] shows a large excess of x - ray sources associated with the optical cluster centers .\nthere is a tight core in which the bcg is within @xmath138 of an x - ray source , as well as a long tail extending out to @xmath139 .\nthe x - ray source excess at large radius is likely to be associated with the maxbcg clusters .\nthese sources comprise a mix of merging clusters , clusters with poorly identified centers , and associated point sources such as agn .\nthe subtracted histogram is used as a first - order empirical radial distribution of x - ray sources associated with maxbcg cluster centers .\nwe now estimate the additional effect on the radial profile due to the radial offset distribution of x - ray sources associated with the maxbcg clusters . we take each wga point source from section  [ sec : rasspsf ] and\nrandomly alter its position so that the distribution is offsets is identical to the empirical radial distribution .\nalthough we have only measured the offset distribution for the brightest @xmath140 of maxbcg clusters , we assume this is a good proxy for the offset distribution between the x - ray emission and bcgs of all the maxbcg clusters .\nthese offset point sources are run through our stacking analysis .\nfigure  [ fig : ptsrc ] shows the radial profile of the offset point sources after stacking ( circles ) .\nthis radial profile is reasonably well fit with a @xmath108 model , although the fit is poor within @xmath141 . at large radii\nthe radial profile is well fit with @xmath142 .\nthus , at large radii it is not possible to distinguish between true _ extended _ cluster emission and x - ray _ point _\nsources convolved with the observed maxbcg \nx - ray source offset distribution .\nthis calls into question the utility of the @xmath108 model parameterization for this exercise .\nthe stacked x - ray profile is a convolution of the rosat psf , the centering distribution , and the true extended x - ray emission .\noperationally , it is not possible to separate the contributions from these three components .\ntherefore , the @xmath108 parameters that are the result of a stacking exercise such as this one , where most of the individual x - ray clusters are not detected , should be used cautiously .\nwe perform spectral fitting of the photons in each stack to calculate x - ray luminosities .\nthe spectra were analyzed using xspec version 11.3.2  @xcite .\nspectral analysis on the stacked rosat data involves a variety of complications , some of which are discussed in dkm07 .\nwe outline some key issues here .\nall rass observations integrate exposure time across the _ rosat _ field - of - view . as a result\n, we use the spectral response file pspcc_gain1_256.rmf from heasarc , suitable for off - axis observations .\nwhen combined with the appropriate ancillary response file ( arf ) , we obtain the vignetting corrected spectral response for the off - axis photons that comprise our spectra .\nhowever , the exposure times extracted from the merged exposure maps for rass are already corrected for vignetting , using the mean spectrum of the x - ray background in the pspc band . in practice\n, this means that our spectra , fit with the standard rmf+arf combination , are corrected for vignetting _\ntwice _  once by using the exposure times obtained from the merged exposure map , and once in the calculation of the arf file . by comparing the on - axis response file rsp from heasarc with the combination of the rmf+arf we can approximate the extra vignetting correction .\nthis correction is a function of energy , and depends ( weakly ) on the spectrum of the observed source . by simulating cluster spectra of various temperatures ,\nwe calculate the typical correction factor averaged across the rosat hard band ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev ) which is dominated by cluster flux .\nthis correction factor is @xmath143 . using this correction factor results in very good agreement between our spectral analysis and the reflex count - rate to flux conversion tables of @xcite .\nwe estimate that applying this correction factor to all flux and luminosity values determined from stacked spectra adds an additional systematic error of @xmath144 .    for our analysis\n, we use the rmf file described above , combined with an arf output with the ftool pcarf .\nas noted in dkm07 , each arf file is essentially identical , because each stacked cluster from rass samples photons from the entire rosat field of view .\nspectral files are then grouped with a minimum of 50 counts per bin ( after background subtraction ) to ensure valid results using @xmath145 statistical analysis .\nfits performed with xspec were restricted to the 0.1 - 2.1 kev range .\nthe uncertainties in spectral fit parameters are 90% confidence errors , obtained by allowing all fit parameters to vary simultaneously .\nwe obtain cluster spectra by summing all weighted cluster photons in both fixed physical apertures and scaled apertures of the optically determined @xmath37 ( see section  [ sec : maxbcg ] ) .\nthe fixed aperture of @xmath146 is chosen as a reasonable fiducial value because this provides good signal - to - noise , and because the radial profiles do not appear to change significantly with richness .\nthe @xmath37 value for each bin was taken as the median @xmath37 of all the clusters in the richness bin ; these values are reported in table  [ tab : lxr200 ] .\nbackground spectra are stacked with the same weights as the source spectra , using the annuli defined in section  [ sec : extraction ] .\nas described previously , each photon is weighted to the median redshift @xmath147 .\nunfortunately , @xmath148-correction of individual photons is not possible , due to the fact that the detection channel of the incident photons is most strongly dominated by the spectral response of the rosat instrument .\nthe stacking procedure will therefore tend to `` smear out '' the incident cluster spectra .\nsimple simulations of x - ray spectra using xspec show that this does not create a large effect on our best - fit spectral values , as our redshift range of @xmath149 is not particularly broad .\nsimilarly , we do not make any corrections for possible redshift evolution in x - ray luminosity ; we will address this further in section  [ sec : redshift ] .\nccccccc @xmath61 & 92.85 & 1.73 & @xmath150 & @xmath151 & @xmath152 & 47.2/76 + @xmath62 & 58.22 & 1.47 & @xmath153 & @xmath154 & @xmath155 & 61.5/77 + @xmath63 & 44.67 & 1.32 & @xmath156 & @xmath157 & @xmath158 & 87.4/65 + @xmath64 & 35.74 & 1.20 & @xmath159 & @xmath160 & @xmath161 & 100.6/95 + @xmath65 & 29.57 & 1.10 & @xmath162 & @xmath163 & @xmath164 & 62.9/95 + @xmath66 &\n22.70 & 0.99 & @xmath165 & @xmath166 & @xmath167 & 113.2/97 + @xmath67 & 18.91 & 0.94 & @xmath168 & @xmath166 & @xmath169 & 77.3/88 + @xmath68 & 13.88 & 0.82 & @xmath170 & @xmath171 & @xmath172 & 182.3/134 + @xmath69 & 9.80 & 0.73 & @xmath173 & @xmath174 & @xmath175 & 127.8/112 +    ccccccc @xmath61 & 92.85 & 1.73 & @xmath176 & @xmath177 & @xmath178 & 40.5/61 + @xmath62 & 58.22 & 1.47 & @xmath179 & @xmath180 & @xmath181 & 40.1/59 + @xmath63 & 44.67 & 1.32 & @xmath182 & @xmath183 & @xmath184 & 85.6/61 + @xmath64 & 35.74 & 1.20 & @xmath185 & @xmath186 & @xmath187 & 92.0/81 + @xmath65 & 28.57 & 1.10 & @xmath188 & @xmath189 & @xmath190 & 78.1/84 + @xmath66 & 22.70 & 0.99 & @xmath191 & @xmath192 & @xmath193 & 86.0/94 + @xmath67 & 18.91 & 0.94 & @xmath194 & @xmath195 & @xmath196 & 73.6/76 + @xmath68 & 13.88 & 0.82 & @xmath197 & @xmath171 & @xmath198 & 182.3/134 + @xmath69 & 9.80 & 0.73 & @xmath199 & @xmath200 & @xmath201 & 137.6/114 +    the spectra are fit with an absorbed thermal plasma model  @xcite .\nthe metallicity is fixed at 0.3 solar  ( e.g. * ? ? ?\n* ) , and the redshift is set to the median scaled redshift of 0.2296 .\nthe luminosities are calculated in the rest -

2.4 kev ) relation .\nwe see the cluster temperature increase with luminosity , but our observed @xmath0@xmath203 relation is noticeably steeper than that of @xcite .\nthe stacked x - ray temperatures appear to underestimate the expected temperature , especially at @xmath0 larger than a few times @xmath205 .\nthis discrepancy highlights the challenge of measuring cluster temperatures with rosat , as well as the challenges of measuring stacked cluster temperatures .\nfirst , rosat has sensitivity only to soft x - rays .\nwhen the break of the bremsstrahlung spectrum , determined by the temperature of the hot gas , is above @xmath206 , then the x - ray temperature becomes difficult to constrain .\nthe _ rosat\n_ temperatures of hot clusters are generally underestimated ; a particular example is abell 1689 .\nthis bright cluster has a nearly isothermal profile in _\nxmm / newton _ observations with a temperature of @xmath207 ( consistent with the asca and _ chandra _ values ) , but has a best - fit _ rosat_/pspc temperature of @xmath208  ( e.g. * ? ? ?\nsecond , when we stack many non - isothermal clusters with different temperatures , our isothermal raymond - smith spectrum is no longer appropriate .\nfor example , @xcite have shown for _ chandra _ observations how the spectroscopically - weighted temperature can differ significantly from the emission - weighted temperature for single clusters , with the better measured colder gas dominating the spectral fit .\nwhen these effects are combined , interpreting the average best - fit spectral temperature from a stack of hundreds of clusters is non - trivial .\nmost importantly for our task of measuring the mean @xmath0 , the rosat luminosity in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev band is virtually insensitive to the cluster temperature .\nif we fix the spectral temperature to the value predicted by the @xcite @xmath5@xmath204 relation , then @xmath0 changes by @xmath209 in each bin , with no systematic bias with richness .\nsimilarly , we can follow the prescription of @xcite to convert the mean 0.5 - 2.0 kev rass count rate to flux and luminosity .\nthis method assumes the @xcite @xmath5@xmath204 relation , and requires iteratively calculating the flux and temperature .\nthe @xmath0 values thus obtained are consistent with those from the spectral fitting to within @xmath210 .\nall this suggests that calculating 0.1 - 2.4  kev @xmath5 obtained from _\nrosat_which relies primarily on photon counting  is more robust than calculating @xmath204 and extrapolating to @xmath202 .\nalthough a small @xmath148-correction ( @xmath144 ) is required to extrapolate from observer frame 0.1 - 2.4  kev to rest - frame luminosity , this correction is not very sensitive to the spectral temperature at the moderate redshift of the maxbcg clusters .\nwe stack the clusters and calculate the 0.1 - 2.4 kev x - ray luminosity as described in the previous section .\nfigure  [ fig : lxn200plot ] shows the mean @xmath0@xmath1 relation , both for a fixed @xmath146 aperture and for the scaled @xmath37 apertures .\nwe find a strong correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 with both the fixed and the scaled apertures . in the low richness bins ( @xmath211 ) , the scaled aperture @xmath37 is approximately equal to the fixed @xmath146 aperture , and @xmath0 is approximately the same for both choices of aperture . in the high richness bins ,\nthe scaled aperture @xmath37 is significantly larger than @xmath146 , yielding a slightly larger @xmath0 for the scaled apertures .\nfor this reason , the @xmath0@xmath1 relation is slightly steeper using scaled apertures .\nthe best -

ray luminosity of the 2mass clusters scales with optical richness ( @xmath17 ) . a direct comparison between the dkm07 relation and our relation is challenging , due to the different luminosity and richness definitions we employ , but a first - order conversion is possible .\nfirst , we convert the dkm07 bolometric luminosities ( their table 2 ) to _ rosat _ 0.1 - 2.4 kev luminosities using table 5 of @xcite . ]\nre - fitting for the @xmath0@xmath17 relation , we find @xmath215.@xmath17 relation does not deviate from a power - law at any richness , unlike the @xmath216@xmath17 relation in figure 10 of dkm07 .\n] as the 2mass catalog is not yet public , we can not make a direct comparison of @xmath6 to @xmath17 for individual clusters .\nfuthermore , most of the clusters in the 2mass catalog are at @xmath217 , while the maxbcg catalog covers @xmath218 . at this time ,\nthe most we can say is that the slope of the @xmath0richness relation is roughly similar between our work and dkm07 .\ncomparisons to x - ray selected catalogs ( see section  [ sec : xrayselect ] ) as well as prior studies  ( e.g. * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ) lead us to expect significant scatter in the x - ray luminosity  richness relation for individual clusters . with a large scatter ,\nthe mean statistic used to calculate the stacked @xmath0-@xmath1 relation may be significantly biased relative to the median relation . to understand this bias\n, we first assume that there is a log - normal conditional probability @xmath219 for the x - ray luminosity of a cluster at richness @xmath6 : @xmath220,\\ ] ] with constant intrinsic scatter @xmath221 , and mean log luminosity that follows : @xmath222 where @xmath223 is the log normalization of @xmath5 at @xmath214 , and @xmath224 is the slope of the @xmath5@xmath6 relation .\nnote that @xmath225 for a log - normal distribution is equivalent to the median ( and geometric mean ) of the distribution . for the duration of this paper\n, we employ the notation @xmath226 .    at a given richness\n, we wish to measure the median x - ray luminosity @xmath227 , the peak of the underlying log - normal distribution\n. however , the stacking exercise we have undertaken is fundamentally a calculation of the _ arithmetic mean _ ( @xmath0 ) at a given @xmath1 . for a log - normal distribution with median @xmath227 and intrinsic scatter @xmath221 ,\nthe arithmetic mean is @xmath228 .\nthus , the stacked normalization is an overestimate of the median of the underlying distribution by a factor of @xmath229 .\nif the scatter is large , the stacked ( mean ) normalization will be dominated by the most luminous clusters and will be biased high .\nfor example , an @xmath230 scatter indicates a @xmath231 bias .    to constrain this scatter ,\nwe begin with measurements of x - ray flux ( and hence @xmath5 ) at the locations of each cluster with @xmath232 .\nthough many of these are low signal - to - noise detections , they can be used to measure scatter .\nthe idl astronomy library tool linmix_err is used to fit @xmath5 as a function of @xmath6 with intrinsic scatter @xmath221  @xcite .\nthis tool uses a bayesian approach to linear regression with errors in x and y and is well behaved even when the measurement errors dominate .\nit also handles non - detections and upper limits in y. monte carlo simulations show that the selected @xmath6 cut provides a large enough richness range to constrain the slope and scatter , and provides larger signal - to - noise than the entire cluster catalog , as over @xmath230 of the 955 clusters with @xmath233 are detected at at least the @xmath106 level .\nfurthermore , the fits are not sensitive to the precise richness cutoff chosen .\nto calculate the @xmath5 for each of these often marginally - detected clusters , we use a procedure based on the count - rate to flux conversion method from the reflex survey  @xcite .\nfirst , we calculate the 0.5 - 2.0 kev ( rosat hard channel ) count rate in a @xmath146 aperture ; the fixed aperture was used because it results in better signal - to - noise than a larger scaled aperture ( where we only see significant signal in the stacked profiles ) .\nthe local background is calculated in a @xmath234 annulus using the sector - rejection method of @xcite .    in reflex the temperature\nis estimated in an iterative fashion from the luminosity , using the @xmath5@xmath204 relation of @xcite . as most of the maxbcg clusters\ndo not have a significant flux ( or luminosity ) measurement , we can not calculate the individual cluster temperatures in this way . instead\n, each cluster temperature is approximated by the stacked spectral temperature from the appropriate richness bin , as shown in table  [ tab : lx750 ] .\nthis ensures that our stacked cluster luminosities and individual luminosity estimates are on approximately the same footing .\nperhaps more importantly , changing the temperature does not change the 0.1 - 2.4 kev luminosities significantly  ( e.g. * ? ? ?\nfor example , for the clusters with @xmath235 detections , if we follow the reflex iterative recipe to convert count rate to @xmath5 , rather than fixing the temperatures at the stacked values , the individual @xmath5 values change by @xmath236 .\nthis is simply another example of how measuring temperatures with rosat is challenging .\nthe 0.5 - 2.0 kev count rate is then converted to 0.1 - 2.4 kev luminosity using table 2 from @xcite with the equivalent hydrogen column density at the position of the cluster  @xcite . after converting to luminosity\n, a @xmath148-correction is applied using equation 4 from @xcite , which is a good approximation of table 3 in @xcite.z\\}^{1/2}$ ] . ]\nthe @xmath148-corrections are not very large , at most 10% .\nwe compared our method of calculating @xmath5 for individual clusters to the @xmath5 values obtained in the noras catalog ( see section  [ sec : xrayselect ] for details on the x - ray catalog matching ) .\nfor the matched clusters the values are all consistent within errors with @xmath237 scatter , and a systematic offset of @xmath238 . the primary difference in our calculations\nis that the noras fluxes were calculated in an aperture obtained via growth curve analysis ( gca ) designed to obtain the best signal - to - noise for each cluster , while we use a fixed physical aperture .\ntherefore , our fixed temperature and aperture provide an unbiased estimate of the cluster flux and luminosity even without _ a priori _ knowledge of extended cluster emission .\nindividual cluster @xmath5 and @xmath6 values are shown in figure [ fig : linmix ] .\nwe use linmix_err to estimate the power - law slope , normalization , and intrinsic scatter of the underlying distribution of the @xmath5@xmath6 relationship for the 955 richest clusters with @xmath239 .\nthe best fit relation is : @xmath240 with an intrinsic scatter @xmath241 .\nthe individual @xmath5 values are calculated within a fixed @xmath146 aperture , and thus this is to be compared to equation  [ eqn : lxn_750 ] .\nwe test the robustness of this result by both splitting the input data into multiple independently fit subsamples and changing the richness threshold slightly .\nwe find that the constraint on the scatter is robust , and the error bar is accurate .\npossible systematic biases in the constraint on @xmath221 are discussed in section  [ sec : coolcore ] .\nthe scatter - corrected @xmath227@xmath1 relation is shown in figure  [ fig : linmix ] .\nthe luminosities for the individual @xmath106 detections are plotted as solid circles , and the @xmath106 upper limits are plotted as empty circles . the typical error bar for detections\nis shown in the lower - right corner .\ncontours showing the @xmath242 contours on the best - fit median relation are shown in dark gray , and the dashed ( dotted ) lines show the @xmath243 ( @xmath244 ) scatter constraints .\nthe median relation as constrained by linmix_err has been converted to the equivalent mean relation by multiplying the normalization by @xmath229 , and is shown in light gray .\nthe mean relation agrees well with the individual stacked bins ( squares ) , which are about @xmath231 brighter than the underlying median values .\nwe must emphasize that we are measuring the _ observed _ scatter in the @xmath5@xmath6 relation as is appropriate to our catalog and stacking method .\nthis scatter comes about not only due to intrinsic @xmath5 variations between the clusters ( including different morphologies and merging clusters ) , but is also due to point sources , cooling flows , and the projection of multiple clusters along the line of sight . for the @xmath245 richest clusters ( @xmath246 ) used in this exercise , the chance of projection is very low .\nwe do not have any way to remove point sources or bright cool cores from individual clusters in an unbiased way .\noperationally , it is not relevant to our measurement whether the scatter is due to intrinsic @xmath5 variations or due to point source and cool - core contamination . to constrain the observed scatter ,\nwe need only assume that the underlying distribution is approximately log - normal , which is consistent with our observations .\n@xcite measure the observed scatter in the @xmath5@xmath247 relation , where @xmath247 is a richness measure from the amplitude of galaxy - cluster correlation function  @xcite .\nthey use 290 optically - selected clusters , of which 40 have significant detections in _ rosat_/pspc observations . using a bayesian maximum - likelihood fitting technique\n, they find a significant correlation between @xmath5 ( bolometric ) and @xmath247 , with a power - law slope of @xmath248 and an intrinsic scatter of @xmath249 .\nit must be noted that they introduce a prior weighting , @xmath250 , which gives more weight to models with lower scatter .\nagain , it is difficult to directly compare our measurement of the slope and scatter to the @xcite measurements , due to different richness quantities and selection functions .\na large intrinsic scatter in the @xmath5@xmath6 relation can account for optically - selected clusters that appear `` underluminous '' in x - rays as compared to their optical richness  ( e.g. * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ) . in particular , @xcite present a set of `` abell x - ray underluminous '' ( axu ) clusters with masses determined from velocity dispersion measurements , that are significantly dimmer in x - rays than expected . in figure\n[ fig : linmix ] the seven axu clusters that match to maxbcg ( @xmath2 , @xmath233 ) are denoted with open squares .\nthese are all significantly dimmer than the mean @xmath5@xmath6 relation , but are fully consistent with the observed scatter .\nvelocity dispersion measurements of maxbcg clusters  ( b07 ) and comparisons to simulations  @xcite have shown that there is considerable mass - mixing in a given @xmath6 bin .\nthe low - luminosity clusters could be from lower - mass halos that are picked up as moderate richness in the cluster finder .\nhowever , @xcite argue that the axu clusters have low @xmath5 relative to their mass .\nthis could be due to biases in masses calculated from velocity dispersions with small samples  ( e.g. * ? ? ?\n* ) , or to large intrinsic scatter in the @xmath5@xmath13 relation  ( e.g. * ? ? ?\neach of these possibilities ( or a combination of the two ) are consistent with the observations .\nwe further explore the @xmath5@xmath13 relation of maxbcg clusters in a companion letter  @xcite .\nwe have reason to believe that the scatter is not fixed as a function of richness .\nfor example , b07 find a significantly larger scatter in the velocity dispersion - richness ( @xmath251@xmath1 ) relation at low richness compared to high richness\n. however , the quality of our data for this exercise is not adequate to constrain the change in the scatter as a function of richness .\ntherefore , for the remainder of the paper we adopt this nominal value of @xmath241 to correct the stacked ( mean ) @xmath0 to obtain the underlying median @xmath227 values .\nthis essentially requires us to multiply all @xmath0 values by a factor of @xmath252 .\nwe can compare the @xmath227@xmath1 relation for optically - selected maxbcg clusters to that from x - ray selected clusters from the literature .\nfor this exercise we chose to compare to the noras  @xcite and 400 square degree  ( 400d : * ? ? ? * ) catalogs , both constructed from rosat data , and thus measured in the same energy range as used in this work .\nthe noras catalog is an x - ray flux limited cluster catalog constructed from the rass photon maps in the northern sky .\nalthough it is known to be only @xmath55 complete , it provides a large sample of bright x - ray clusters that overlap the maxbcg survey region .\nthe 400d catalog is a serendipitous x - ray flux limited cluster catalog constructed from pointed rosat pspc observations .\nthe 400d catalog covers fields sampled from the whole sky , and thus only @xmath249 of the catalog overlaps the maxbcg survey region .\nour intention in this exercise is to obtain a baseline comparison of the x - ray and optical richness properties of x - ray selected clusters to optically - selected clusters .\na somewhat different comparison of noras and maxbcg , focused on testing the completeness of maxbcg , was performed in @xcite .    to obtain a list of clean matches between noras or 400d clusters and maxbcg clusters , we require that the x - ray position and bcg position be matched within @xmath253 , and the redshift difference to be less than 0.05 .\nthis ensures both that the probability of a false match is @xmath254 and that we are not selecting , e.g. , merging clusters where the x - ray and optical catalogs might utilize different deblending schemes .\nthere are 89 noras clusters that match maxbcg , with a median redshift of @xmath255 , and 53 400d clusters that match maxbcg , with a median redshift of @xmath256 .\nwe convert all x - ray luminosities to 0.1 - 2.4  kev in the rest frame with our adopted cosmology .\nnote that the @xmath5 values obtained in noras and 400d have been corrected for aperture effects .\nhowever , with the adopted @xmath108 parameters ( @xmath257 for noras , and @xmath258 for 400d ) these corrections produce at most a @xmath237 offset in @xmath5 compared to the luminosities obtained in our scaled @xmath37 apertures .\nfigure  [ fig : catmatches ] shows @xmath5 vs. @xmath6 for the x - ray selected clusters that meet our matching criteria .\nthe solid circles represent noras clusters , and the empty squares represent 400d clusters .\nthe luminosities of the 400d clusters are typically less than that for noras due to the deeper flux limit of the pointed rosat observations relative to the rass survey .\nthe dashed line shows the median @xmath227@xmath1 relation , and the dotted lines show the @xmath243 scatter constraints .\nit is not surprising to note that x - ray selection picks out primarily the x - ray brightest clusters at a given richness ; nearly all the noras clusters lie above the median maxbcg relation .\nthe deeper 400d survey selects a sample more representative of the optically - selected clusters , though it is still biased high .\ncomparison to figure  [ fig : linmix ] is instructive . at every richness , the typical x - ray emission from clusters is significantly below what you might expect from x - ray selected catalogs .\nwhile this is true for both catalogs , it is especially apparent for noras clusters .\nalthough the 400d survey has the sensitivity to detect the richest x - ray dim clusters ( as in the lower - right corner of figure  [ fig : linmix ] ) , these clusters are quite rare .\nthe limited overlap between the 400d survey region and the maxbcg survey region means that it is very unlikely that the 400d survey would contain one of these specific maxbcg clusters .\nthere are a variety of systematic effects which may bias the @xmath227@xmath1 relation . in this section\nwe address six : photometric redshift uncertainty , cluster centering errors , richness variation with redshift , bcg luminosity , point source contamination , and cool core clusters .\nthe maxbcg cluster catalog is based on photometric data , and thus we only have photometric redshifts ( `` photo-@xmath31s '' ) for each of the clusters . while the photo-@xmath31s are relatively precise ( @xmath11 ) , we must investigate how using photometric redshift estimates might bias our stacking results .\nif a cluster is actually closer than its photometric redshift would suggest , it will be over - weighted in the stacking analysis . when it is more distant than it seems , it will be underweighted .\neven if the photo-@xmath31 errors are perfectly symmetric , the weighting factor , @xmath83 , is not . as a result ,\nuncertainty in photo-@xmath31 can introduce a bias in the luminosities .\nthis bias can become significant if the photo-@xmath31 errors are large .\nthe net impact of this effect is to make the clusters appear more luminous than they truly are .\nthere is also a small volume effect caused by photo-@xmath31 errors . at a fixed redshift @xmath31\nthere is a larger physical volume at a larger distance @xmath259 than at a smaller distance @xmath260 .\nbecause of this , more clusters are available at high redshift to scatter low than at low redshift to scatter high .\nthis is similar to malmquist bias .\nas above , this effect will cause us to overestimate the cluster luminosities .\nin addition , the photometric redshift is used to calculate the cluster extraction radius .\nwhen a cluster is closer than its photo-@xmath31 implies , then the extraction radius used is too small , slightly reducing its implied luminosity .\nthe opposite is true when the cluster is farther than its measured photo-@xmath31 .\nas there is very little cluster flux at large radii , and as this bias is roughly symmetric , we do not expect this effect to strongly bias the stacked @xmath5 .\nwe run a monte carlo simulation to estimate the combined photo-@xmath31 bias as a function of richness . around @xmath261 of the bcgs in the maxbcg catalog used in this analysis\nhave spectroscopic redshifts from the sdss dr5 spectroscopic catalog  @xcite . with the spectroscopic subsample\n, we measure the photo-@xmath31 offset ( @xmath262 ) distribution in each richness bin and three redshift bins .\na monte carlo is performed to estimate the overall bias in the measured luminosity by comparing the `` true '' luminosities convolved with the @xmath263 distribution to the `` observed '' luminosities at the measured photometric redshifts .\nwe find that the overall bias is small ( @xmath264 at 99% confidence limit ) , with the observed luminosities slightly overestimating the true luminosities .\nthis bias factor does not vary with richness .\nwe neglect this correction factor due to its small magnitude .      in our stacking exercise , we chose the bcg as the center of the cluster .\nfor many clusters with individual x - ray observations and a bright bcg , this is coincident with the x - ray center .\nhowever , there are several types of clusters in which the bcg is not consistent with the center of the x - ray emission .\nthese include merging clusters with disturbed morphologies ; clusters without a dominant central galaxy for unambiguous detection by the maxbcg algorithm ; and a few ( @xmath265 ) previously identified strong cooling flow clusters .\nthe central galaxies in these clusters host bright agn and exhibit strong star formation , moving their colors off the red sequence and excluding them from the maxbcg cluster finding algorithm .\nwe do not expect centering biases to be a significant problem for our calculation of the mean x - ray luminosity for the following reasons .\nfirst , the x - ray luminosity is proportional to the electron density @xmath266 , and thus most of the luminosity comes from the central region . with our large apertures ( @xmath267 )\nas long as the core of a cluster is within the aperture , the photon counting exercise will include most of the cluster photons .\nsecond , we have reason to believe from simulations that most of the richer clusters are well centered  ( j07 ) .\nthis is not to say that the cluster centering will not have any effect : as shown in section  [ sec : profiles ] , the @xmath108-model parameter is highly dependent on the centering distribution .    to confirm this , we perform some simple tests of de - centering the clusters . if we randomly offset all the cluster positions with a 2d gaussian with an rms of @xmath268  ( comparable to the centering distribution modeled in j07 ) , the mean @xmath0 values decrease by @xmath269 , and less than @xmath106\nthis rms value was chosen because , as is seen in figure  [ fig : ptmatchhist ] , the vast majority of the x - ray cluster matches are within @xmath253 . therefore , we do not consider cluster miscentering to contribute a significant bias to our x - ray luminosity calculation .\nwe investigate whether the observed @xmath0 at fixed richness changes with redshift .\nmodest evolution in @xmath0 at fixed _ mass _ is expected .\nif the clusters are evolving in a self - similar manner , then we expect the higher redshift clusters to be more luminous than the lower redshift clusters , due to the fact that the universe was more dense at higher redshift .\nthe expectation is that @xmath270 , where @xmath271 is the critical density of the universe at redshift @xmath31  @xcite .\ntherefore , clusters at a given _ mass _ at a redshift @xmath272 should be @xmath273 brighter than similar clusters at a redshift of @xmath274 .\nto study possible variation of @xmath0 at fixed richness , we split the cluster sample into three redshift bins , containing the bottom 25% , middle 50% , and top 25% of clusters in our sample .\nthe low redshift bin ranges from @xmath275 with a median redshift of @xmath276 ; the middle redshift bin ranges from @xmath277 with a median redshift of @xmath41 ; and the high redshift bin ranges from @xmath278 with a median of @xmath279 . to obtain increased signal - to - noise in these bins , we combine richness bins @xmath63 and @xmath62 ; @xmath65 and @xmath64 ; and @xmath280 and @xmath66 .\nthese wider bins are the same that were used in the lensing analysis of s07 .\nfigure  [ fig : splitzplot ] shows the stacked @xmath0 as a function of @xmath1 for the three different richness bins .\nthe dashed line shows the mean relation ( equation  [ eqn : lxn_r200 ] ) for all clusters from section  [ sec : meanrelation ] .\nthe high redshift clusters ( diamonds ) are significantly more luminous than the low redshift clusters ( circles ) .\nwe parameterize the variation with a factor of @xmath281 , and fit all the redshift and richness bins simultaneously with a model of the form : @xmath282 where @xmath41 , the median redshift of the cluster catalog .\nthis results in a good fit ( @xmath283 ) with the best - fit parameters : @xmath284 ; @xmath285 ; @xmath286 . note that @xmath287 and @xmath108 are consistent with the mean relation in equation  [ eqn : lxn_r200 ] .\nthe redshift variation parameter , @xmath288 , is quite large , and shows that the high redshift bin ( @xmath279 ) is almost twice as bright as the low redshift bin ( @xmath276 ) .\nthis is significantly in excess of the self - similar prediction .\nthe challenge is to determine the origin of this redshift dependent shift in @xmath0 at fixed richness .\nthe photo-@xmath31 errors described in section  [ sec : photoz ] may account for some of this effect .\nalthough the absolute photo-@xmath31 errors are better than @xmath289 at all redshifts , the _ relative _ photo-@xmath31 errors are larger at low redshift than at high .\ntherefore , the impact of photo-@xmath31 bias is larger at low redshift than at high redshift .\nwe repeated the monte carlo simulation described in section  [ sec : photoz ] to measure the photo-@xmath31 bias from each redshift bin .\nthe additional redshift bias is @xmath290 ( 99% confidence limit ) in the low redshift bin , and @xmath291 ( 99% confidence limit ) in the high redshift bin .\nthe photo-@xmath31 bias therefore remains smaller than the observed variation in @xmath5 , although the effect is in the same sense as the variation we observe , and is a contributing factor .\na more likely possibility is redshift dependent variation of @xmath6 at fixed mass .\nif our high redshift clusters have systematically smaller @xmath6 at fixed mass , this would have the effect of shifting the high redshift points in figure  [ fig : splitzplot ] to the left . in order to constrain this bias ,\nwe must first factor out the effect of the self - similar evolution of @xmath0 at fixed mass , using the expected redshift dependence @xmath292 as described above .\nwe then re - fit the data to equation  [ eqn : zgamma ] to calculate the excess variation in the @xmath0@xmath1 relation that may be attributed to variation of @xmath6 at fixed mass .\nthis results in a best - fit @xmath293 , implying a fractional decrease in @xmath6 of @xmath294@xmath295 from our lowest redshift bin ( @xmath296 ) to our highest redshift bin ( @xmath297 ) .\nthis is consistent with the redshift dependent variation in the velocity dispersion \noptical richness relation measured by b07 .\nhowever , we must note that redshift dependence in the observed lensing shear , @xmath298 , is significantly smaller  ( s07 ) .\nunfortunately , none of these approaches is yet able to confidently determine the nature of the observed variation .\nfor example , this effect could be caused by incorrect handling of the 0.4  @xmath18 and color cuts that determine which galaxies are included in the richness estimate .\nit might also be `` true '' evolution , such that clusters have fewer red - sequence galaxies brighter than 0.4 @xmath18 at fixed mass at higher redshifts .\nfurther work , including improving the richness estimates , is in progress to constrain the nature of this evolution .\nwe now investigate the effect bcg @xmath30-band luminosity ( @xmath299 , see @xcite for details ) has on the mean x - ray luminosity @xmath0 .\nsimulations and semi - analytical modeling predict that dark matter halos formed at early times have brighter bcgs and lower richness than those which form late  @xcite .\nthus , we expect that the x - ray luminosity should be correlated with @xmath299 at fixed richness .\nfurthermore , optical and x - ray observations of individual nearby clusters show that more luminous bcgs are correlated with more massive halos with higher x - ray temperature and luminosity  ( e.g. * ? ? ?\nthis trend has already been seen in the mean velocity dispersion analysis of maxbcg clusters , as the clusters with more luminous bcgs had significantly larger velocity dispersions than clusters with similar richness  ( b07 ) .    in an exercise similar to that performed in the previous section , we split each wide richness bin into three bins of @xmath299 .\nas @xmath299 , unlike redshift , is correlated with @xmath6 , we are unable to use the same @xmath299 split for each @xmath6 bin .\ntherefore , we sort the clusters in each richness bin by @xmath299 , and split the sample into the top 25% , middle 50% , and bottom 25% , and then restack .\nthe results are shown in figure  [ fig : splitbcgplot ] . it is readily apparent that the clusters with the most luminous bcg in a given richness bin ( diamonds ) are significantly more luminous in x - rays than other clusters in the bin .\nthis effect is most dramatic at lower richnesses .\nthis is expected , as the bcg is more dominant in low richness clusters than high richness clusters  ( e.g. * ? ? ?\nit is also notable that there does not appear to be a significant difference between the @xmath0 for the low @xmath299 and middle @xmath299 bins .\nwe parameterize the effect of @xmath299 on @xmath0 using a similar procedure as performed for the redshift variation .\nthe richness and @xmath299 bins are fit simultaneously with a model of the form : @xmath300 this results in an adequate fit ( @xmath301 ) with the best - fit parameters : @xmath302 ; @xmath303 ; @xmath304 .\nalthough the normalization is the same as in equation  [ eqn : lxn_r200 ] , the slope is significantly more shallow .\nthis is caused by the correlation between @xmath299 and @xmath6 .\nafter taking this into account , the mean relation shown here is fully consistent with that calculated without splitting the bins by @xmath299 .\nthe reason the @xmath145 of the fit is relatively high is because it does not appear that @xmath0 is smooth function of @xmath305 : the effect of @xmath299 is not symmetric , and only tends to boost the x - ray luminosity of clusters with relatively bright bcgs .\nit is not entirely clear whether this effect is due to an imperfect cluster finder , our crude richness definition , or due to real cluster physics .\nclusters with brighter , more dominant bcgs are more likely to be correctly centered and thus might be more luminous in x - rays .\nhowever , as we showed in section  [ sec : centering ] , the effect of decentered clusters on @xmath0 is much smaller than the effect we see due to @xmath299 .\nmeanwhile , our richness definition , @xmath6 , is a count of red - sequence galaxies brighter than @xmath306 .\nit is thus not surprising that a poor cluster with an exceptionally bright bcg might be more massive and more x - ray luminous than a cluster at a similar richness with a more typical bcg .\nfinally , it is possible that these clusters are associated with halos that formed early , allowing many of their member galaxies to merge into a very large bcg  @xcite . deeper targeted x - ray observations of specific clusters will be required to determine if we can use @xmath299 and other optical properties to constrain the age of its dark matter halo .      when calculating the projected x - ray luminosity from the hot intracluster medium , there is the possibility of contamination due to x - ray point sources .\nsome point sources , such as cluster agn , are associated with the cluster , but in general their luminosities are not tightly correlated with that of the icm .\nother point sources that are chance coincidences , such as foreground stars and background quasars , might also boost the apparent luminosity .\nthe problem of point source contamination is exacerbated by the broad psf of the rass survey .\ndue to the large psf , it is difficult to accurately excise point sources from the higher redshift clusters , even when their positions are known . for the stacking exercise ,\nforeground and background sources are not a significant problem . assuming the positions of these point sources are uncorrelated with the cluster positions , the contribution from these sources is subtracted with the background estimation , as is demonstrated by our stack of random points in figure  [ fig : imageplots ] . at the same time , these point sources , both those associated with the clusters and those that are chance projections , may increase the observed scatter . in general\n, we note that @xmath5 values calculated from rass are not corrected for point source contamination  ( e.g. * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\nwe wish to perform a first - order check on possible contamination from cluster agn , the dominating point sources that might bias the observed @xmath0 .\n@xcite have recently performed a detailed survey of the distribution of agn in galaxy clusters for eight moderate redshift clusters , comparable to the redshift range of the maxbcg catalog .\nthey find that moderately bright agn ( @xmath307 ) associated with bright cluster members ( @xmath308 ) make up around @xmath309 of the total cluster member population .\nthis implies that many of the richest maxbcg clusters contain at least one moderately bright agn .\nthese clusters have an extremely bright icm ( @xmath310 ) , and thus the fraction of the luminosity from cluster agn will , on average , be very small .\nif we extrapolate the same agn fraction to our poorest clusters ( @xmath311 , perhaps one in ten will host a moderately bright agn . although these agn might have a luminosity comparable to the icm for these @xmath312 of poor clusters , this small fraction should not strongly bias the stacked average .    as a simple check for contamination in the x - ray signal from cluster agn\n, we match maxbcg cluster member galaxies to radio sources from the first survey  @xcite with a match radius of @xmath313 . by matching random galaxies from sdss dr5 to the first sources\n, we estimate the purity of the matches to be @xmath314 .\nthe first survey covers approximately the same footprint as the sdss , down to a typical flux limit of @xmath315 at 1.4 ghz .\nusing 1.4 ghz radio detections as a proxy for agn activity has the advantage that the radio spectrum is often flat , and thus the 1.4 ghz flux is not a strong function of redshift .\nthe disadvantages are that only 10% of x - ray bright quasars and agn are radio loud , and that there is a large scatter between x - ray and radio luminosities of these objects . for example\n, @xcite noted that for the same small set of clusters none of the x - ray selected agn are radio loud  @xcite .\nalthough we have an incomplete selection function , we can still constrain the contamination from cluster agn . if the mean @xmath0 is significantly boosted by cluster agn\n, then we would expect the clusters which match radio sources to be relatively bright .\nthis effect would be greatest at low richness and low @xmath0 when the icm is not as hot or bright .\nfor each richness bin , we matched the maxbcg cluster members within @xmath146 of the bcg to sources in the first survey .\ntable  [ tab : radiomatch ] shows the number of clusters in each bin that have members matched with the first catalog .\nmore detailed work is in progress in cross - correlating the maxbcg catalog with radio sources to explore cluster agn feedback and related issues ( see also @xcite ) .\nccc @xmath61 & 45 & 82% + @xmath62 & 91 & 65% + @xmath63 & 125 & 62% + @xmath64 & 183 & 54% + @xmath65 & 284 & 45% + @xmath66 & 420 & 37% + @xmath67 & 332 & 30% + @xmath68 & 1330 & 25% + @xmath69 & 1341 & 18% +    we wish to compare how the radio selected subset of clusters compares to a randomly selected subset of clusters of similar richness . in each richness bin , we ran 10000 trials by sampling ( with replacement ) from the entire set of clusters in the bin , sampling the same number of clusters that match radio sources . as a quick estimate of the mean luminosity , rather than performing the full stacking analysis and spectral fits , we calculated the stacked and weighted , background - subtracted hard channel ( 0.5 - 2.0 kev ) counts in a fixed @xmath146 aperture .\nthe resulting count rate was converted to @xmath0 using the method described in section  [ sec : scatter ] .\nwe can then compare the mean @xmath0 of the clusters which match radio sources to the typical values of @xmath0 that we would expect when drawing that same number of clusters from the entire sample .\nthe results are shown in figure  [ fig : radiomatch ] . in each panel\nthe histogram shows the distribution of @xmath0 values obtained from the resampling , and the vertical dashed line marks the mean @xmath0 of the radio - matched clusters .\nwe do not see any significant bias as a function of richness .\nthe only bin in which the radio matches appear to be outliers is the @xmath316 richness bin .\nthis is due to random chance , in that the clusters in this richness bin with the highest @xmath5 also happen to match radio sources ; although there is no obvious indication in the rass data that there is point source contamination on these clusters , further follow - up with _ chandra _ or _ xmm / newton _ would be required to clarify this .\nthere is much evidence that cool core clusters increase the scatter in x - ray cluster properties . by excluding cluster cores in high resolution imaging ,\nmany x - ray parameters become more tightly correlated  ( e.g. * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\nthe broad rosat psf , combined with the fact that most of our clusters do not have individual x - ray detections , makes it impossible to exclude cluster cores in our stacking analysis . however , a few of the brightest clusters ( @xmath317 ) at moderate richness ( @xmath318 ) are well known cool - core clusters .\nwe thus investigate what effect cool core clusters have on our estimate of the median @xmath227 and scatter @xmath221 in the @xmath227@xmath1 relation .\nthere does not exist an unbiased volume - limited catalog of cool core x - ray clusters which can be fairly compared to the maxbcg catalog .\n@xcite used rosat pointed observations of an x - ray flux limited catalog  @xcite to estimate the central cooling time of 55 nearby clusters .\ntwo of these clusters are in the maxbcg catalog ( a1689 , a2244 ) and exhibit characteristics of a cool core ( @xmath319 ) .\n@xcite used _ chandra _ observations of the higher redshift ( @xmath320 ) bcs clusters to systematically estimate the central cooling time of bright x - ray clusters .\nwe identify 7 maxbcg clusters ( a750 , a963 , a1835 , rxj 2129.6 + 0005 , z2701 , z3146 , z7160 ) from this sample with cooling times @xmath319 which we mark as cool core clusters .\nfinally , we identify clg  j1504 - 0248  @xcite as maxbcg cluster with a cool core .\nit should be noted that most of these clusters have a moderate richness ( @xmath321 ) and are in the brightest tail of the @xmath5 distribution for their richness .\nfurthermore , the central galaxies of these clusters tend to show strong @xmath322 emission in sdss spectroscopy .\nin fact , for a few of these clusters the true bcg is not in the list of cluster members because the strong @xmath322 emission changes the apparent galaxy color , making it inconsistent with the red - sequence used in the cluster finding algorithm .    after excluding these known cool core clusters ( which might bias the @xmath227@xmath6 relation ) we recalculate the stacked mean relationship as well as the median relationship with scatter . when calculating the median relationship with scatter , as in section  [ sec : scatter ] , the normalization and slope shift by @xmath323 , as these values are not strongly affected by outliers .\nhowever , the intrinsic observed scatter decreases to @xmath324 , which is a @xmath325 shift .\nit is not surprising that @xmath221 decreases : we are deliberately removing the brightest clusters .\nmeanwhile , the stacked relation is also slightly affected by these bright outliers , and after cutting the known cool core clusters the normalization of the stacked relation decreases by @xmath326 . after following the previously described prescription for converting the stacked mean relation to a scatter - corrected median relation\n, we find that removing the known cool core clusters decreases the normalization by @xmath209 .\ntherefore , it does not appear that the known , very x - ray luminous , cool core clusters , are significantly biasing our relation .\nwe reiterate that the intrinsic scatter we measure is the _ observed _ scatter that takes into account _ all _ x - ray observations of the maxbcg clusters , regardless of x - ray morphology of the clusters .\nthus , it is likely that some portion of this observed scatter is caused by unidentified cool core clusters in the sample .\nb07 have measured the median velocity dispersion ( @xmath328 ) as a function of @xmath1 for the maxbcg catalog .\nthe richness bins used to measure the stacked velocity dispersions , as well as the scatter in the @xmath12@xmath6 relation , are the same as those used in this work . however , in order to measure velocity dispersions , only clusters that have the bcg and at least one additional member galaxy in the sdss dr5 spectroscopic subsample  @xcite were used .\nthe spectroscopic subsample preferentially selects bright / nearby galaxies , and thus the selection of clusters used in b07 ( @xmath329 , with @xmath330 ) is slightly different than that for the full maxbcg catalog ( @xmath331 , with @xmath332 ) . as discussed in section  [ sec : redshift ] , the lower redshift clusters have a smaller @xmath0 than the higher redshift clusters .\nwe therefore re - run our stacking procedure on exactly those clusters used in b07 , and use the known spectroscopic redshifts of the bcgs rather than the photometric redshifts .\nthis ensures that , for this exercise at least , we are not affected by any possible photometric redshift biases , which otherwise could be significant for the nearest clusters ( @xmath333 ) where the relative photo-@xmath31 error ( @xmath334 ) is quite large . table  [ tab : lxsig ] shows the richness bins used , as well as the mean @xmath0 ( this work ) and median @xmath327 ( from b07 ) for the nine richness bins .\nthe slope of the @xmath0@xmath1 relation is nearly identical for the spectroscopic subsample as reported in section  [ sec : meanrelation ] , but the normalization is lower by @xmath312 , due to the different redshift selection .\nccccc @xmath61 & 83.9 & 1.69 & @xmath335 & @xmath336 + @xmath62 & 58.4 & 1.45 & @xmath337 & @xmath338 + @xmath63 & 44.7 & 1.32 & @xmath339 & @xmath338 + @xmath64 & 35.9 & 1.22 & @xmath340 & @xmath341 + @xmath65 & 28.6 & 1.10 & @xmath342 & @xmath343 + @xmath66 & 22.7 & 1.02 & @xmath344 & @xmath345 + @xmath67 & 19.0 & 0.94 & @xmath346 & @xmath347 + @xmath68 & 14.0 & 0.82 & @xmath348 & @xmath349 + @xmath69 & 9.9 & 0.73 & @xmath350 & @xmath351 +    we take the mean @xmath0 values and corrected them for scatter as described in section  [ sec : scatter ] to obtain @xmath227 .\nfigure  [ fig : lxsig ] shows the median @xmath227@xmath327 relation for maxbcg clusters with richness @xmath352 . each data point ( solid circles ) is obtained from the same richness bin and same cluster selection .\nthe dark gray band shows the best -

2.4  kev luminosities to @xmath202 , this would steepen our relation , as the clusters with higher velocity dispersions also have a higher temperature and larger @xmath356 ratio .\nas mentioned previously , such a conversion is not practical for the stacking exercise using rosat data .\nthe slope of our 0.1 - 2.4 kev @xmath227@xmath327 relation is consistent with that measured for reflex clusters  @xcite .\nwe compare this median relation to that obtained previously for individual x - ray selected clusters .\n@xcite calculated the velocity dispersions of reflex clusters by cross - correlating the reflex catalog with the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey  ( 2df ; * ? ? ?\nfigure  [ fig : lxsig ] shows 39 individual reflex clusters ( empty circles ) from hilton , et al .\n( 2007 , private communication ) after converting the velocity dispersions to the cluster rest frame . in the upper - left corner\nthe empty circle shows the typical errors in 0.1 - 2.4 kev @xmath5 and @xmath12 for the reflex/2df clusters .\n@xcite found the slope of the x - ray selected @xmath5@xmath12 relation to be @xmath357 , consistent with our observations .\nhowever , the individual x - ray selected clusters tend to have a slightly higher ( @xmath326 ) velocity dispersion at a given x - ray luminosity compared to the stacked maxbcg clusters .\nthis is possibly caused by the difficulty in measuring velocity dispersions for individual clusters .\ncontamination from non - virialized galaxies and interlopers will more likely result in an overestimate of the velocity dispersion rather than an underestimate .\nby stacking observations from the _ rosat _ all - sky survey , we measure the mean x - ray luminosity as a function of richness for optically - selected clusters from the maxbcg catalog . with a large number of clusters in each bin , the stacking exercise has the power to probe to much lower flux limits than are possible for x - ray selected surveys .\nthus , a highly pure and complete volume - limited catalog with clusters selected by their optical properties can be used to measure the mean @xmath0 .\nwe find that @xmath0 scales with optical richness , @xmath6 , with a simple power - law form over two orders of magnitude in @xmath0 .\nour results are similar to those obtained in dkm07 by stacking rass observations of clusters identified in 2mass .\nhowever , we find that stacked temperature measurements from _ rosat _ are significantly biased for higher temperature clusters .\ntherefore , we restrict our analysis to luminosities calculated in the 0.1 - 2.4  kev band rather than extrapolating to calculate bolometric luminosities . furthermore , we have shown that the @xmath108-model fits to the stacked radial profiles of moderate redshift clusters are dominated by a combination of the broad _ rosat _ psf and the offset distribution between maxbcg clusters and correlated x - ray sources . on the other hand , calculating x - ray luminosity in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev band , which relies primarily on counting photons , is not strongly biased by spectral fits or profile fits . as @xmath5 scales with the square of the density , as long as the core of a cluster is within the stacking aperture , we can obtain a high reliability estimate of the mean cluster luminosity .    by measuring the x - ray flux at the positions of individual maxbcg clusters , we are able to constrain the observed scatter in the @xmath5@xmath6 relation . assuming a log - normal distribution of @xmath5 as a function of @xmath6 , we find @xmath241 .\nthis scatter is quite large , and thus it is necessary to correct for the scatter when calculating the median of the underlying distribution @xmath227 .\nthe richness measure we have used in this work , @xmath6 , is simply the count of red - sequence galaxies within a scaled @xmath37 aperture , but nevertheless is a good proxy for @xmath5 on average .\nit is likely that improved richness measurements can be made . from the evidence presented here , it seems likely that these new richness estimators will include information about bcg luminosity , and will more carefully control variations in cluster membership with redshift .\nthe large scatter in the @xmath5richness relation does have some significant effects on cluster selection .\nfirst , x - ray selection with a high flux limit , as with the noras catalog , tends to pick out the clusters with the highest @xmath5 at a given richness .\nsecond , the large scatter in the @xmath5@xmath6 relation means that there are a significant number of optically selected clusters that are seemingly `` underluminous '' .\noptically selected clusters will often appear relatively dim compared to x - ray selected clusters at a similar richness .\nthe goal of cluster selection and identification is to find a low scatter proxy for halo mass .\nboth x - ray and optical selection techniques suffer from different limitations .\nx - ray flux limited surveys can only find the brightest x - ray clusters , and are thus limited to a combination of the brightest and nearest clusters . furthermore , there may be significant scatter between x - ray luminosity and halo mass  @xcite .\noptical surveys such as maxbcg may be volume limited out to moderate redshift , but optical richness also has a large scatter with respect to x - ray luminosity and mass  ( b07 ) .\nthe development of more precise mass proxies , including @xmath204 , the compton y parameter @xcite , @xmath358  @xcite , and potentially more sophisticated optical richness estimates may allow selection of cluster catalogs more closely approximating the mass - limited catalog we aspire to .    by combining our present analysis with the velocity dispersion measurements of b07\n, we have measured the median @xmath227@xmath327 relation for the maxbcg clusters .\nthe relation has a slope of @xmath359 , consistent with the prediction of self - similar cluster evolution .\nprevious measurements of the @xmath5@xmath12 relation have been complicated by both selection effects and a large scatter , as the derived slope depends strongly on the fitting technique used . by stacking clusters from a volume - limited catalog and correcting for scatter , both @xmath227 and @xmath327\nare much better constrained , allowing a robust calculation of the relation . in our analysis\n, we do not see any evidence of a break in the @xmath227@xmath327 relation at the poor cluster ( group ) scale , as has been hinted at previously  ( e.g. * ? ? ?\n. this might be due to the fact that the maxbcg cluster finder works with red - sequence clusters , and does not find groups with a large blue galaxy fraction .\nwe can also compare @xmath0 as determined from this method to weak lensing masses determined from the same maxbcg cluster catalog  ( s07 , j07 ) .\ndetermining the @xmath5@xmath13 relation is not only important for understanding cluster physics , but for calibrating the selection function of x - ray clusters used as cosmological probes  ( e.g. * ? ? ?\nwe have made this measurement in a companion letter  @xcite .\nin addition , the comparison of the x - ray luminosities , weak lensing masses , and velocity dispersions can be used in conjunction with the number function of maxbcg clusters to constrain cosmological parameters  ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .\nthis work is ongoing .\nrefined measurements of the scatter , point source contamination , and confirmation of catalog purity will require deeper pointed x - ray observations .\nwe are currently investigating serendipitous maxbcg cluster observations by deeper pointed _ rosat_/pspc observations , as well as _\nxmm / newton _ and _ chandra _  ( e.g. * ? ? ?\nunfortunately , most of the serendipitous cluster observations are of relatively poor clusters , which are much more numerous .\na targeted campaign of a representative sample of maxbcg clusters that have not previously been known to be x - ray bright will be essential to both test our measurement of the scatter in @xmath5@xmath6 and to estimate the fraction of cluster flux that is contaminated by point sources .\nthis will be essential to enable future inexpensive deep optical cluster surveys such as des  @xcite to use optical properties of clusters to estimate which clusters would be most useful to follow -

[ fig7]b ) .\nwe find that , even after normalization with the shot noise , the strength of these correlations is dependent on all parameters , while in the opo it was constant for any pump e. moreover , in fig .\n[ fig7]b it is clear that the correlations are degraded and can become classical below threshold ( above red line ) .\nfinally , in fig .\n[ fig7]c we present normalized twin beams correlations when only the pump detuning is modulated . in this case\ncorrelations remains quantum for all pump strengths below threshold , even if there is a small reduction of this quantum effect .\nan interpretation of these results can be given considering the modulation effects from the microscopic point of view .\na modulation in the signal ( pump ) detuning has the main effect to couple different spatial modes as also clear from eq.([eq : enfourier ] ) . in the particular case of a pc modulation with the periodicity ( [ 2kc ] )\nthere are actually creation and destruction processes between photons at the critical tilted modes @xmath114 .\neven if the nonlinearity gives rise to simultaneous creation ( annihilation ) of photons pairs in the signal , spatial modulation of the signal detuning leads to photons hopping between these opposite modes .\nin other words there is a process of creation of one photon ( say @xmath115 ) and destruction of one in the opposite mode ( @xmath116 ) , as can be also seen from inspection of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) .\ntherefore , twin beams correlations , due to photon pairs emission , are present for small hopping rates , but when the detuning modulation of the signal is increased , the variance ( [ twin - m1 ] ) becomes classical as the twin beams are depleted uncoherently . on the other hand , for @xmath42 and modulating the detuning of the pump field ,\nthe hopping between different pump harmonics is still detrimental , as it triggers different secondary processes besides the twin photons pairs generation , but has a reduced effect .\nwe have shown the effect of an intracavity pc in a typical device displaying quantum light spatially correlated in continuous variables , as it is the degenerate opo type i. due to the translational symmetry breaking in the transverse profile there are several effects also evident in the noisy precursors locking ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .\nthe pc modulation has a deep influence in the instability process and parametric threshold are both raised and lowered depending on the configuration ( fig .\n[ fig5 ] ) . as a consequence a modification in twin beams correlations , squeezing , separability , and entanglement were expected . in order to analytically evaluate these quantum correlations\nwe have introduced two main approximations valid below threshold , linearizing around the steady state where the signal field vanishes and restricting our analysis to few relevant harmonics ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) .\nwe have considered a pc modulation ( [ 2kc ] ) and five modes , @xmath117 for the pump and @xmath118 for the signal . under these approximations we obtained good agreement between our results and the numerical solution of the full multimode nonlinear model , eqs .\n( [ eq : lang ] ) .    in our prototype model\nthe pc leads to a sinusoidal variation on the refractive index and , therefore , of the detunings that can affect pump , signal or both fields , depending on the values of the pc modulations @xmath119 and @xmath110 .\ndifferent configurations are described by tuning these parameters .\nwhen the pc modulates the signal field , i.e. @xmath105 , the instability threshold rises in agreement with previous works concerning single resonant cavities and predicting pattern inhibition  @xcite .\nwe demonstrate that in presence of a parametric process the scenario is more complex and actually the threshold can also be reduced , when @xmath78 , and the instability favored .\nnon - classical phenomena such as squeezing and entanglement are very sensitive to the proximity of the instability point .\ntherefore the pc has deep consequences and can improve correlations at a given pump with respect to the opo , at least when threshold is lowered ( pump modulation ) . apart from this effect ,\nall correlations have been compared in opo and pcopo at a fixed distance from threshold .\nthen we have found that squeezing ( fig .\n[ fig4 ] ) , separability , and epr - entanglement ( fig .\n[ fig6 ] ) are preserved both in the reached values and in the width of the quadrature and superposition angles regions where these phenomena appear .\nfinally , we have analytically calculated twin beams correlations ( fig.[fig7 ] ) when varying the pc modulations @xmath119 and @xmath110 showing that deeper effects are actually present in these intensity correlations , even at a fixed distance from the threshold , and that in general secondary processes degrade correlations . besides , numerical simulations above threshold presented in a previous work  @xcite have revealed a significant enhancement of squeezing and entanglement .\noverall , the pc allows to obtain the same quantum effects at a lower energy and one can enhance / avoid quantum properties of light , just by changing pump and/or signal spatial modulation in the cavity .\nif we fourier transform in the temporal variable eqs .\n( [ eq : enfourier ] ) and neglect all the terms with @xmath121 in the signal and pump , we obtain @xmath122 where @xmath59 modes are coupled between them , namely @xmath123 we use a compact notation and denote @xmath124 simply as @xmath125 , @xmath126 as @xmath127 , and similarly for @xmath128 .\nlet us call @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 then we can write the matrix @xmath133 as @xmath134 this matrix allows the dynamical description of the fluctuations for all modes such that @xmath135 , with continuous index @xmath30 .    when considering the modulation @xmath136 with @xmath137 critical wavenumber , few intense modes are relevant and a reduced description can be obtained , leading to the @xmath138 matrix given in eq .\n( [ eq : matl ] ) .\nthe output fields dynamics is governed by the eqs .\n( [ eq : in -

dish telescopes , which can identify whether or not a particular class  i transition produces masers in a region ( and how bright they are ) but do not have the resolution to determine their location relative to masers in other transitions .\ngiven the complex environments associated with clustered star formation , high angular resolution is required to identify the relations between masers and excitation sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and between multiple transitions of methanol @xcite .\nhigher angular resolution is also necessary to understand the physical conditions that produce masers in each of the class  i transitions , which may not be identical ( e.g. , * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\nthese concerns motivated @xcite to do an unbiased single -

resolution images of 36  ghz masers to be produced @xcite . in this letter\n, we report on the first evla maps of the 36  ghz masers in the dr21 star - forming complex .\nthe evla was used to observe the 36.169  ghz @xmath0 line of methanol in dr21(oh ) , dr21w , and dr21n on 2010 may 26 . the array consisted of the 20 telescopes outfitted with ka -

frequency observing ( @xmath6 a few @xmath7  kms@xmath2 ) is only a fraction of the channel separation ( and much smaller than a typical maser linewidth ) , the data were not corrected with cvel .\nwe present 229.758  ghz @xmath8 maser and 226  ghz continuum sma data for all of our sources ( p.  pratap et al .\n, in preparation ) .\nthe angular resolution of these observations is @xmath9 .\nthe bandwidth of the 229  ghz observations covered the velocity range from @xmath10 to @xmath11  kms@xmath2 with a spectral resolution of 0.13  kms@xmath2 .\nthe flux densities of the 229  ghz masers were corrected for primary beam attenuation .\nthe rms noise near field center was approximately 0.15  jybeam@xmath2 for dr21(oh ) and dr21n and 0.3  jybeam@xmath2 for dr21w .\nwhen possible , we compare our data against three other class  i methanol maser transitions from the literature : 44  ghz ( @xmath12 ) , 84  ghz ( @xmath13 ) , and 95  ghz ( @xmath14 ) . for dr21n , we also used archival 44  ghz data taken with the vla in b -

dish observations @xcite .\nspectra of the integrated flux of individual 36  ghz maser features are often not well fit by a single gaussian . in some cases multiple spectral peaks\nare evident , while in others there is evident skewness in the spectral peak .\nboth of these cases imply the existence of structure on scales smaller than our synthesized beam size ( 12 ) .\nsimilar effects are seen in the 44  ghz transition , in which @xcite detect 17 masers in dr21(oh ) ( several with multiple spectral peaks ) using 10 minutes of vla d - configuration data , while @xcite detect 49 masers using a much longer integration of c - configuration data . when individual maser spectra in our data do show a single clear peak , we find that typical linewidths are on the order of 0.15 to 0.35  kms@xmath2 .\nthere is also a signature of very weak , extended methanol emission in some sources , but the lack of proper bandpass calibration tempers our confidence in this result .\nthere are 14 arcsecond - scale overlaps of a 36  ghz and a 229  ghz maser at approximately the same velocity ( @xmath15  kms@xmath2 ) . of these 14 associations , the 36  ghz maser is brighter in 7 , and the 229  ghz maser is brighter in the other 7 , indicating that either of the two @xmath16 lines may be brighter ( with the caveat that the 36 and 229  ghz observations did not occur simultaneously and that maser variability is possible ) .\na similar phenomenon is seen in the @xmath17 series , where @xcite find that while the integrated 95  ghz flux is in general higher than that at 44  ghz , the integrated fluxes of sources whose spectra consist of _ narrow - velocity _ 44 and 95  ghz features ( where the two transitions presumably produce single masers in close spatial association ) are comparable in the two transitions .\nfurther high - resolution data will be necessary to examine the relation between the flux densities of different maser transitions seen in close spatial association with each other .\nlrrrr dr21n & @xmath181.21 & 5.46 & 6.07 & 0.96 + & 3.30 & 1.33 & 0.76 & 23.72 + & 3.35 & 1.36 & 5.42 & 0.17 + & 5.10 & 3.25 & @xmath1812.58 & 0.31 + & 6.01 & @xmath180.43 & 3.22 & 0.40 + & 6.19 & @xmath180.26 & 6.07 & 0.19 + & 6.24 & @xmath186.84 & @xmath183.38 & 1.63 + & 7.73 & 10.83 & @xmath181.31 & 0.28 + & 8.56 & @xmath181.12 & @xmath182.61 & 0.28 + & 9.63 & 4.45 & @xmath184.94 & 0.25 + & 10.77 & 3.29 & @xmath185.71 & 0.18 + & 11.01 & @xmath183.54 & @xmath184.42 & 0.96 + & 11.28 & @xmath182.57 & @xmath184.42 & 0.37 + & 11.57 & @xmath184.19 & @xmath184.16 & 0.65 + & 12.54 & 8.44 & @xmath185.71 & 0.15 + & 12.75 & @xmath180.09 & @xmath184.42 & 0.31 + & 13.07 & @xmath184.16 & @xmath184.03 & 0.60 + & 13.30 & 5.92 & @xmath184.16 & 0.36 + & 14.64 & @xmath186.39 & @xmath183.12 & 10.08 + & 16.74 & @xmath183.14 & @xmath184.03 & 0.22 + & 20.77 & 11.47 & @xmath185.20 & 6.46 + dr21(oh ) & @xmath1825.86 & @xmath1824.96 & @xmath181.48 & 2.66 + & @xmath1821.08 & @xmath1820.95 & @xmath186.01 & 0.36 + & @xmath1818.88 & @xmath1830.34 & 0.47 & 2.67 + & @xmath1816.99 & 0.75 & 0.47 & 30.26 + & @xmath1816.34 & @xmath180.68 & @xmath181.35 & 1.26 + & @xmath1814.39 & @xmath1836.24 & @xmath185.62 & 0.60 + & @xmath1811.92 & 1.25 & @xmath180.05 & 1.31 + & @xmath1810.96 & 1.77 & @xmath181.35 & 0.52 + & @xmath1810.52 & @xmath181.72 & @xmath180.57 & 1.49 + & @xmath189.93 & @xmath182.98 & 0.08 & 10.39 + & @xmath187.10 & @xmath180.57 & @xmath181.61 & 2.39 + & @xmath186.24 & @xmath182.10 & 0.08 & 1.81 + & @xmath182.38 & @xmath1832.23 & @xmath185.49 & 0.82 + & 0.33 & @xmath1829.47 & @xmath185.88 & 0.54 + & 2.63 & @xmath1845.86 & @xmath184.20 & 7.61 + & 3.38 & @xmath1845.66 & @xmath185.62 & 0.86 + & 3.45 & 0.78 & @xmath183.68 & 0.15 + & 9.52 & @xmath184.73 & @xmath186.53 & 1.69 + & 13.40 & @xmath187.31 & @xmath185.88 & 0.42 + & 13.94 & @xmath182.89 & @xmath183.55 & 0.50 + & 15.48 & @xmath183.87 & @xmath184.71 & 0.85 + & 15.49 & @xmath184.07 & @xmath184.97 & 0.54 + & 15.54 & @xmath185.61 & @xmath183.68 & 0.46 + dr21w & @xmath189.57 & @xmath1818.45 & @xmath184.90 & 0.30 + & @xmath188.08 & @xmath1812.63 & @xmath185.54 & 0.43 + & @xmath187.78 & @xmath1813.23 & @xmath182.31 & 0.93 + & @xmath182.16 & 0.69 & @xmath182.44 & 24.60 + & @xmath181.21 & @xmath181.40 & @xmath182.44 & 82.29      the most striking feature of the masers in dr21(oh ) is the central region of the source , where numerous masers in all mapped transitions occur in an approximately elliptical structure ( figure  [ fig -

zeeman ] ) , which will be discussed further in section  [ magnetic ] .\nthe bright masers near the origin in figure  [ fig - maps - n - w ] are coincident with the 44  ghz masers detected by @xcite to better than a synthesized beamwidth .\nthe velocities of the 36  ghz masers near the origin agree with the velocities of the brightest nearby 44  ghz masers to within 0.2  kms@xmath2 or better .\ndr21n was first identified as a 36  ghz maser source by @xcite .\nwe detect numerous 36  ghz masers in this source , mostly in the range from @xmath26 to @xmath27  kms@xmath2 , on the eastern side of the distribution of maser emission ( figure  [ fig - maps - n - w ] ) .\nseveral redshifted masers in the range @xmath28 to @xmath29  kms@xmath2 are found on the western side , along with one highly blueshifted maser ( @xmath30  kms@xmath2 ) .\nall detected 229  ghz masers are found in close proximity to ( @xmath31 from ) a 36  ghz maser .\nin contrast , no 44  ghz maser is seen within 1  of a 36  ghz maser .\nas shown in figure  [ fig - zeeman ] , we detect an antisymmetric `` s - curve '' stokes v signature in the spectrum of the brightest maser in dr21w .\nif interpreted as due to zeeman splitting , the implied line - of - sight magnetic field strength is @xmath32  mg , where @xmath33 represents the zeeman splitting coefficient ( assumed to be 1.7 hzmg@xmath2 for the 36  ghz transition by * ? ? ?\nthe direction of this component of the magnetic field would be oriented away from the observer .\nthe full three - dimensional field strength would presumably be larger , as zeeman splitting measures only the line - of - sight component of the magnetic field when the splitting between zeeman components is much less than the line width @xcite .\nstokes v s - curves were not detected in any of the other maser sources , with a @xmath34 upper limit of @xmath35  mg in the brightest remaining maser in dr21(oh ) , although we note that a circular polarization fraction of @xmath36 ( i.e. , the v / i seen in dr21w ) would not produce a detectable ( @xmath37 ) stokes v signal in dr21(oh ) or in any of the weaker masers .    however , there is significant uncertainty in the zeeman splitting coefficient , which calls into question the direct zeeman interpretation of methanol stokes v s - curves . @xcite obtained a laboratory estimate of the land @xmath38-factor for the 25  ghz @xmath39 series of transitions of methanol , but the obtained value is an average over several different transitions and , in any case , may not be appropriate for the 36  ghz transition of methanol . @xcite and @xcite used the @xcite @xmath38-factor to estimate the zeeman splitting coefficient for the 6.7  ghz transition , and @xcite followed their method in deriving the zeeman splitting coefficient at 36  ghz .\na more recent look suggests that these calculations may have overestimated the zeeman splitting coefficients by an order of magnitude ( w.  h.  t.  vlemmings 2010 , private communication ) , which would serve to _ increase _ proportionally the putative magnetic field strengths reported from methanol zeeman splitting in this work and others ( e.g. , * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ) .    even if the @xcite zeeman splitting coefficient for the 36  ghz transition is ( approximately ) correct , a line - of - sight magnetic field strength of 58  mg is uncomfortably high .\nmeasurements of the magnetic field strength are often used as a proxy for density . using a scaling of @xmath40 from the densities and magnetic fields of dr21\nwould give a number density around @xmath41  @xmath42 @xcite , a value several orders of magnitude higher than that though to be suitable for 36  ghz maser excitation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\nscaling from values typically found in oh masers instead ( a few milligauss , @xmath43  @xmath42 ; * ? ? ?\n* ; * ? ? ?\n* ) results in density estimates well in excess of @xmath44  @xmath42 , which is still substantially larger than theoretical estimates ( but see also section 4.3 of * ? ? ?\nthe discrepancy between the implied density and theoretical calculations appropriate for class  i maser activity grows by two orders of magnitude if a smaller zeeman splitting factor is assumed ( w.  h.  t.  vlemmings 2010 , private communication ) .\nif the zeeman interpretation is correct , one possible explanation for the discrepancy is that the correlation between magnetic field strength and density does not hold in ( all ) the environments of class  i methanol masers , implying that the magnetic energy density is much greater than the kinetic energy density @xcite .\nalternatively , it is possible that the high density implied by the large magnetic field is correct , and the bright 36  ghz maser in dr21w is produced via a pumping scheme not normally assumed for class  i masers .\ntypically , class  i masers are thought to be produced by collisional excitation followed by spontaneous cascade down to lower energy levels , with sink photons escaping or being absorbed by cold dust .\nthis mechanism has an upper limit for density , above which the inverted transition is thermalized by collisions .\none possible pumping mechanism at higher densities involves collisional excitation by a warm species and a collisional sink by a cooler species to produce the population inversion @xcite .\nthis mechanism requires a two - temperature mixture of particles , such as electrons ( and/or ions ) and neutrals , that may exist after the passage of a shock front . in principle\n, such a collisional - collisional pump can operate at arbitrarily high density , as long as the temperature difference between the two species is sustained .    however , it is more probable that the stokes v signature we detect does not measure the magnetic field directly .\n@xcite proposed a mechanism by which changes in the magnetic field orientation can convert linear polarization to circular polarization along the amplification path in a maser .\nthe stokes v signature produced by this mechanism can produce an s - curve that can mimic the effect of zeeman splitting of a much larger magnetic field . in the case of circumstellar sio masers that @xcite consider ,\ntheir proposed mechanism could operate with a magnetic field as weak as 0.1% of the magnetic field strength implied from interpreting the s - curve as purely due to zeeman splitting .\nthe @xcite mechanism requires that the zeeman splitting in units of frequency exceed both the stimulated emission rate and the decay rate appropriate for the masing transition , a condition likely to be satisfied for class  i methanol masers ( see section 4.2 of * ? ? ?\ninterestingly , dr21w ( this work ) and m8e @xcite , the two sources with detected zeeman splitting in the 36  ghz line , are also the two sources in which @xcite detected circular polarization in the 133  ghz ( @xmath45 ) transition .\nfuture high - sensitivity observations at 133  ghz might permit detection of an s - curve signature in stokes v , thereby testing whether the magnetic field implied from a pure zeeman interpretation is consistent with the values derived at 36  ghz .\n( since the 36  ghz and 133  ghz methanol lines are both @xmath16 transitions , the same land @xmath38-factor would be applicable to each of them . )\ncareful laboratory measurements of the zeeman splitting coefficients appropriate for the brightest methanol maser transitions would also be very helpful .\nexcitation models indicate that the physical conditions that are thought to produce inversion in class  i transitions usually lead to anti - inversion in class  ii transitions and vice versa @xcite . in that regard , the existence of class  i 36 and 229  ghz masers at the same velocity and location as the class  ii 6.7  ghz maser site is surprising .\nthese masers are also coincident with the brightest continuum emission near the outflow , which may be an important clue to their origin .\nthere is precedent for overlaps between class  i and class  ii methanol masers . @xcite\ndeduce spatial coincidences between the 6.7  ghz class  ii and 25  ghz @xmath46 series of class  i methanol masers in omc-1 , although the angular resolution of their interferometric observations is much poorer than either the 229  ghz data on which we report or the @xcite 6.7  ghz data .\n@xcite model the 6.7/25  ghz overlap as arising from a lower - temperature regime than is typically assumed for class  ii masers .\nthis pumping model requires an intermixed environment of gas and dust at a lower temperature ( @xmath47  k ) than for traditional class  ii maser formation . the strong 226  ghz continuum emission in dr21(oh )\nlikely marks such an environment that is rich in dust .\nthe @xcite model did not investigate excitation at 229  ghz , but it does predict inversion at 36  ghz , which is also a @xmath48 transition .\nthe model predicts that 44 and 95  ghz masers should _ not _ appear at a low - temperature 6.7  ghz maser site , since the former are @xmath17 transitions , while the latter is a @xmath49 transition .\nindeed , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite do not report 44  ghz masers at this location .      in each of the sources we observed , the 36  ghz masers divide into two sets : those that are found to be cospatial with other class  i maser transitions , and those that are spatially isolated .\nwe address each of these two groups in turn .    in the outflow of dr21(oh ) and in the cluster in the north of dr21w\n, we note that the distribution of the 36  ghz masers is similar to that of the 44 , 84 , 95 , and 229  ghz masers .\nadditionally , the brightest masers in all of these transitions appear in the same location . in dr21(oh ) , the brightest masers in all class  i transitions occur in a narrow velocity range ( @xmath50 to @xmath51  kms@xmath2 ) at the western tip of the outflow .\nthe next - brightest masers in each transition appear approximately 10  east of this position ( i.e. , 10  west of the origin in figure  [ fig - map - oh ] ) .\nit is clear that these masers exist in a physical regime in which strong maser emission is produced in a large number of @xmath52 and @xmath17 transitions simultaneously .\nthe existence of a nearby energetic source creating an outflow likely shocks the surrounding molecular material , pumping multiple transitions of methanol in the same location .\non the other hand , all sources contain regions in which 36  ghz masers are not found to be coincident with other transitions .\nfor instance , numerous masers in both the 36 and 44  ghz masers are found to the south of the outflow in dr21(oh ) .\nfor the most part , the two transitions are not seen to be spatially coincident .\nmost of the 36  ghz masers and some of the 44  ghz masers in the south are seen near the periphery of cs emission @xcite .\nthe common feature of the environment of these masers is the lack of a nearby energetic source . as in the sagittarius  a region , it is possible that these masers trace molecular density clumps that are shock - excited by core collision or compression @xcite .\nthe 229  ghz masers appear to align more closely with the 44  ghz masers than with the 36  ghz masers in the dr21(oh ) outflow .\nwhile 229  ghz masers are found to be coincident with 36  ghz masers on the western side of the outflow , there is always an accompanying 44  ghz maser .\nin contrast , several 229  ghz masers appear coincident with 44  ghz masers but without 36  ghz emission , especially on the eastern side of the outflow .\nhowever , we note several caveats about drawing conclusions from these points .\nfirst , the angular resolution of the observations of both the 44  ghz and the 229  ghz masers is higher than that of the 36  ghz observations on which we report , and it is possible that more sensitive , higher - resolution observations of the 36  ghz masers will uncover other features at the sites of the 44/229  ghz overlaps .\nsecond , every detected 229  ghz maser in dr21n appears near a 36  ghz maser site ( figure  [ fig - maps - n - w ] ) .\nthird , at present the three dr21 sources on which we report are the only sources mapped in all three of the 36 , 44 , and 229  ghz transitions , and the field of view encompassed by the 229  ghz observations in dr21(oh ) excludes nearly all of the masers south of the outflow as well as the eastern tip of the outflow itself .\nthis constitutes a rather small set of sources from which to draw general conclusions about the properties of the 36 , 44 , and 229  ghz masers relative to each other .\nmore interferometric observations of both the 36 and 229  ghz transitions will be required to fully understand the phenomenology of either .\nwe have interferometrically imaged three sources in the 36 and 229  ghz class  i methanol maser lines .\nwe find numerous masers in both transitions and a diversity of conditions among them .\nnotably , we identify the following three environments , each of which may correspond to a different set of excitation conditions .\nthe outflow in dr21(oh ) contains a large number of overlaps in the 36 , 44 , and 229  ghz transitions .\nstrong emission is also seen at 84 and 95  ghz , although there is a lack of high - resolution observations of these lines .\nthe brightest masers in all transitions appear at the same velocity and in the same location at the western tip of the outflow as traced by the masers .\nthe bright continuum source in dr21(oh ) is associated with both the class  ii 6.7  ghz masers and class  i 36 and 229  ghz @xmath53-type masers , but the class  i 44  ghz @xmath54-type masers are conspicuously absent .\nthis environment may be explained by the low - temperature intermixed dust and gas model of @xcite .\nthe 229  ghz transition produces detectable masers at a subset of the 36  ghz maser sites in dr21n . in both this source and in dr21(oh ) well south of the outflow , the 36 and 44  ghz masers have a similar large - scale distribution but are rarely found to produce a maser at the same site .\nin addition , the brightest maser in dr21w produces an antisymmetric stokes v profile that implies a large magnetic field if interpreted as being due to zeeman splitting .\nthere is a very large uncertainty in the zeeman splitting coefficient appropriate for the 36  ghz transition , but the implied density ( assuming @xmath55 ) greatly exceeds the range over which class  i masers are thought to form .\nit is possible that the circular polarization in this maser feature is produced by a much smaller magnetic field whose orientation changes over the amplification path of the maser @xcite . in any case ,\ncareful laboratory measurement of zeeman splitting coefficients appropriate for methanol maser transitions is warranted given the increasing number of zeeman - like stokes v signatures identified in methanol transitions over the past few years .    in order to realize the goal of being able to identify the physical conditions in a variety of star - forming regions by the presence or absence of various methanol maser transitions\n, it will be necessary to understand a few sources in greater detail .\nour results highlight the need for both increased theoretical effort and more sensitive observations of multiple class  i transitions at higher angular resolution .\nin particular , higher - resolution maps of the 84 and 95  ghz transitions as well as higher - frequency maser lines may be both enlightening and timely in the advent of the alma era .\na further survey of sources in the 36 and 229  ghz transitions , when combined with 44  ghz maps in the literature , may also be helpful in determining the range of possible methanol excitation conditions in nature .\nt.  c.  m.  acknowledges support from the national science foundation s research experiences for undergraduates program .\nthe national radio astronomy observatory is a facility of the national science foundation ( nsf ) operated under cooperative agreement by associated universities , inc .\nthe submillimeter array is a joint project between the smithsonian astrophysical observatory and the academia sinica institute of astronomy and astrophysics and is funded by the smithsonian institution and the academia sinica .\nwe thank w.  h.  t.  vlemmings and a.  sarma for helpful discussions regarding methanol zeeman splitting coefficients .\nsobolev , a.  m. , ostrovskii , a.  b. , kirsanova , m.  s. , shelemei , o.  v. , voronkov , m.  a. , & malyshev , a.  v.  2005 , in iau symp .\n227 , massive star birth : a crossroads of astrophysics , ed .\nr.  cesaroni , m.  felli , e.  churchwell , & m.  walmsley ( cambridge : cambridge univ .  press ) , 174", "abstract": " class  i methanol masers are believed to be produced in the shock -

layer incoming edges only , whereas a publication that has influenced the work of researchers in more than one field has inter - layer incoming edges too , which represent the bridges between the different fields involved .\ntherefore this framework allows for a natural representation of the interdisciplinarity degree of a publication .\nbeing our goal to rank publication producers too , we introduce in the network a second type of nodes , which , according to the specific need , represent scholars , inventors , research institutions , or countries .\nthese nodes are active on a dedicated layer , and each publication has directed outgoing inter - layer edges pointing to each of its producers .\nprevious works on ranking producers are based on one - mode projections of the bipartite network of publications and producers , whereas in this work we prefer to take advantage of the complete bipartite structure in order to avoid any information loss , as further detailed in the supplementary material .    on the proposed network\n, the ranking is obtained through a process of diffusion of scientific credits from paper to paper through citation edges within and across disciplines .\nproducers are the sinks of this diffusion process , being represented by nodes with no outgoing edges , and incoming edges originated from the papers they have produced .\na schematic representation of the proposed network is shown in figure  [ explicative -

energy physics in which all the project collaborators are listed as co - authors . to disambiguate author s name\n, we used a simple technique introduced in previous studies  @xcite .\nmeta - data in the dataset provide information about the topic of the papers through the specification of the assigned `` physics and astronomy classification scheme '' ( pacs ) code , developed by the american institute of physics ( aip ) and used in physical review since 1975 to identify fields and sub -

topic analysis that serves to proof the usefulness of the method .\nthe second dataset contains the u.s .\npatents granted between january 1963 and december 1999 , and all citations made to these patents between 1975 and 1999  . to define the layers\n, we used the 6 categories proposed in previous studies  @xcite : _ chemical ( excluding drugs ) _ ; _ computers and communications _ ; _ drugs and medical _ ; _ electrical and electronics _ ; _ mechanical _ ; _ others_. each patent is assigned to one main class defined by the united states patent and trademark office ( uspto ) , and to any number of subsidiary classes .\neach class belongs to one of the listed categories , therefore each patent is associated with one or more layer according to its classes .\nhowever , the dataset only contains the information about the main class , therefore we complemented it by extracting the information about the other classes from the uspto patent grant full text  .\nthe final dataset contains 1574882 patents , 1142499 inventors , 138833 assignees ( i.e. corporations for the most part ) , and 127 countries .\nfigure  2 shows the evolution of the interdisciplinary ranking of the world top physics departments , and of the world top companies , over time . this visualization allows to observe , for instance , the raise of the university of texas at austin during the 1990s , after the establishment , in 1985 , of the center for nonlinear dynamics , funded and directed by the boltzmann medal laureate harry swinney  .\ncompared to previously proposed algorithms of diffusion of scientific credit , the proposed method rewards researchers that have carried out interdisciplinary works or have had an impact in different scientific areas . to show this , we first compare it with the science author rank algorithm ( sara )  @xcite .\nwe find that the rankings of aps authors obtained using sara and using the proposed method have a spearman s rank correlation of 0.77 ( @xmath59 confidence level ) .\nthe high value of correlation is to be expected since both methods rank researchers simulating a diffusion process on a citation network .\nhowever , the proposed method gives higher ranking to versatile researchers such as the self - organised criticality pioneer per bak ( + 21 positions gained ) , econophysics co - founder eugene stanley ( + 56 ) , complex networks pioneer shlomo havlin ( + 104 ) , and complex systems professor leonard m. sander ( + 93 ) .\nwe show that the proposed method is in fact able to capture two fundamental aspects of interdisciplinary research : intrinsic multidisciplinarity ( i.e. publishing papers or patents pertaining to different areas ) on the one hand , and effective interdisciplinarity , i.e. being credited by different scientific areas , on the other .\nwe define the _ topical interdisciplinarity _\n@xmath60 of an author @xmath2 ( who could be a scholar or an inventor ) as the average number of different scientific areas her / his publications pertain to , i.e. : @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the number of publications authored by @xmath2 , and @xmath63 is the number of fields that publication @xmath64 belongs to .\nmoreover , for each publication @xmath65 we define an entropy metrics based on the distribution of its incoming citations across the different fields represented by the different layers : @xmath66 where the sum is over the different fields ( layers ) and @xmath67 is the proportion of edges incident in @xmath65 that come from layer @xmath34 . therefore if a publication is only cited by other publications belonging to its own field @xmath68 ,\nwhereas a publication that has received citations from different fields has @xmath69 , and the higher the number of fields it has had impact on , the higher its entropy . for each author @xmath2 we then compute her / his _ citation interdisciplinarity _ @xmath70 as the average entropy of her / his publications : @xmath71    we find a strong positive correlation between the gain in rank that scholars and inventors obtain when evaluated using the proposed method  instead of a method based on a flat representation of the citation network  , and their topical interdisciplinarity ( figure  3 , panels ( a ) and ( b ) ) .\nmoreover , we find that the rank gain is also positively correlated with the disciplinary diversity of scholars and inventors incoming citations ( figure  3 , panels ( c ) and ( d ) ) . to control for the effects of productivity , i.e. the fact that a researcher that produces more papers has more chances to publish in more areas or to be cited by papers in many different areas , we perform the same analysis on two subsets of the data by considering in each case only authors with a fixed number of publications ( @xmath72 and @xmath73 ) .\nthe correlation coefficients found in these subsets are consistent with those found using the whole dataset , demonstrating that the proposed method is not biased by productivity .\nthe results are reported in the supplementary material .\ncoefficient , and setting the statistical significance at @xmath74 .\nsolid lines represent density gradient contours , and dashed lines represent linear regression models estimated via maximum -

citations  @xcite , the choice of the appropriate citation time window  @xcite , field normalisation  @xcite , and author credit allocation  @xcite . despite the vast literature on the subject\n, consensus is still lacking on how to solve these issues . here , we propose a method whose objective is to account for interdisciplinarity , and we do not enter those debates .\nhowever , the bipartite interconnected multilayer networks of citations and disciplines that we introduce can be adapted to take into account specific needs .\nfor example , edges connecting papers to their authors could be weighted differently to take into account non - homogeneous allocation of credit , or a specific time window could be chosen a priori to select the papers constituting the network .\ngoing beyond the presented assessment of the benefits produced by interdisciplinarity , the method proposed in this work could constitute a tool for funding agencies and academic hiring decision makers to quantify the impact of interdisciplinary research and its producers , for a faster advancement of excellent science .\na.a . , e.o . and m.d.d .\nacknowledge financial support by the spanish government through grant fis2015 -

mode projection .    for the sake of simplicity\n, we will consider a bilayer version of the network .\nour focus here is not in fact the multilayer aspect of the network capturing interdisciplinarity , but rather its bipartition .\ntherefore , let us consider @xmath75 nodes and 2 layers @xmath76 .\nthe 4 components of the rank@xmath8 adjacency tensor @xmath29 are now defined as follows .\n@xmath77 encodes information about citing relations between papers , _ i.e. _ @xmath78 if paper @xmath34 cites paper @xmath35 .\n@xmath79 encodes information about paper authorship , _ i.e. _ @xmath80 if author @xmath35 is one of the authors of paper @xmath34 . finally , we define @xmath81 and @xmath82 to be zero tensors , consistently with the representation introduced in s.1 . for the sake of simplicity , since in the rest of the section we will be dealing only with rank-2 tensors , we will make use of the simpler classical matrix notation instead of the tensorial one . therefore we will denote @xmath77 as @xmath83 and @xmath79 as @xmath84 . in the author citation network proposed in @xcite ,\neach node represents an author , and @xmath85 if there exist at least one publication @xmath49 , of which @xmath34 is an author , that cites a publication @xmath86 of which @xmath35 is an author .\neach such publication gives a contribution @xmath87 to @xmath88 ( where @xmath89 is the number of authors of publication @xmath49 , and @xmath90 is the number of authors of @xmath86 ) so that the total contribution of each citation is equal to 1 .\nlet us consider an adjacency matrix @xmath91 of size @xmath92 , encoding the citation links between papers .\n@xmath83 can be built from @xmath91 by means of multiplication with a rectangular matrix @xmath93 of size @xmath94 such that @xmath95 for @xmath96 , and all the other elements are equal to 0 .\nthen @xmath97 using @xmath93 we can also build @xmath84 from the projection matrix @xmath98 , of size @xmath99 , where @xmath100 if @xmath35 is one of the authors of paper @xmath34 : @xmath101 let us define @xmath102 as the normalised version of @xmath98 , _\ni.e. _ @xmath103 ( where @xmath104 is the number of authors of paper @xmath34 ) , then the @xmath105 adjacency matrix representing the network of citations between authors can be obtained performing two successive matrix multiplications : @xmath106 _ proof : _ @xmath107\nthis means that @xmath108 is a sum over the papers authored by @xmath34 that cite paper @xmath109 , where each paper @xmath0 gives a contribution of 1 over the number of authors .\nthen : @xmath110 each element @xmath111 is therefore a sum over all the pairs of papers @xmath112 such that @xmath34 is an author of @xmath0 and @xmath35 of @xmath109 , and each element of the sum gives a contribution equal to @xmath113 , as indeed defined in @xcite .\n@xmath114    we have demonstrated that the adjacency matrix of the author citation network is obtained performing two operations of matrix multiplication involving @xmath91 and @xmath98 .\nmatrix multiplications consists in multiplications and summations of the matrix elements , which inevitably lead to information loss .\nthe supra - adjacency matrix of the network proposed in this paper is instead the sum of the two expansions of @xmath91 and @xmath98 , _ i.e. _ @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively .\nthis guarantees that no information is loss , and this why we chose to consider the whole bipartite structure .\nfigure [ toy - model-1 ] shows an example in which the information loss characteristic of the author citation network leads to a less fair ranking of authors compared to the ranking based on the network introduced in this paper . using our approach ( top figure )\n, the most central author is @xmath115 , who is the author of both the most central paper and of one of the second most central papers .\nhowever , in the author citation network framework , the most central author is @xmath84 ( to understand why , we recall that the pagerank centrality is based not only on the number of incoming edges , but on the importance of the nodes from which these edges originate ) .\nthis is due to the fact that in the author citation network all the information about an author s incoming citations from different papers is aggregated , and therefore @xmath84 benefits from the importance of @xmath115 without any distinction between the importance coming from papers that actually cite @xmath84 , and that coming from @xmath115 s other papers . in this case @xmath115\ns most central ( and cited ) paper is not the one citing @xmath84 s paper , but this information is lost in the author citation network . as a consequence , the resulting ranking does not always reflect the real importance of the different authors .\nan alternative approach is to use the pagerank method to get the centrality of papers in @xmath91 , and then compute the author centrality as a properly normalised sum of the centralities of the papers she / he has authored . in matrix terms , the author pagerank centrality vector @xmath116 can be obtained by simply applying a linear transformation to the paper pagerank centrality vector @xmath117 : @xmath118 however , this solution involves another kind of aggregation which can lead to misleading results too .\nan example is shown in figure [ toy - model-2 ] . using the sum approach ,\nauthor @xmath119 becomes more central than author @xmath84 , because she / he authored two papers , even though they are the two most marginal papers in the network ( note that the only citation to paper 4 is a self - citation ) . on the contrary , @xmath84 is the author of a very central paper , and in fact our approach correctly classifies her / him as more central than @xmath119 .\nthe issue with this alternative approach is that the pagerank is a diffusion process , which is not a linear dynamics .\ntherefore summing over the centralities of different nodes is also an aggregation process through which some information on the system is lost .\nin figure  3 of the main text , we show that we find a strong positive correlation between the gain in rank that scholars and inventors obtain when evaluated using the proposed method  instead of a method based on a flat representation of the citation network  , and their topical interdisciplinarity ( panels ( a ) and ( b ) ) .\nmoreover , we show that the rank gain is also positively correlated with the disciplinary diversity of scholars and inventors incoming citations ( panels ( c ) and ( d ) ) . to control for the effects of productivity , i.e. the fact that a researcher that has produces more papers has more chances to publishes in more areas or to be cited by papers in many different areas , we perform the same analysis on two subsets of the data by considering in each case only authors with a fixed number of publications . figure  [ control_20papers ] shows the result for the subset of authors and inventors with @xmath72 publications , and figure  [ control_50papers ] for authors and inventors with @xmath73 publications\n. the results are consistent with those obtained using the whole dataset .\npublications obtain when evaluated using the proposed method  instead of a method based on a flat representation of the citation network  , and two measures of their interdisciplinarity level .\nthe x -

infrared regime .\nthe spectral function @xmath68 , shown in fig .\n[ aomega ] for the parameters used in fig .\n[ fig4b ] , has its major contribution from transitions near the light - holes bands fermi wave - vectors ( the lower frequency peak in @xmath68 ) and near the heavy - holes fermi wave - vectors ( the higher frequency peak in @xmath68 ) , visible for @xmath90 and @xmath91 .\nthe transitions that contribute to first order in @xmath66 are between heavy and light holes with opposite polarization as shown in appendix [ 4bdetails ] .     calculated within the 4-band model the itinerant hole and mn concentrations of fig .\n[ fig4b].,width=326 ]    we also note that there is a considerable contribution to @xmath65 from the high frequency part of the spectral function ( accounts for rigid shifts in the low frequency range ) which indicate the possible need to consider higher bands , maybe including the conduction bands , for more realistic calculations .\nthe qualitative physics behind the the 4-band model calculation results still applies to the full model numerical calculations . however , the effects on @xmath3 due to the lifetime broadening of the quasiparticles , finite spin - orbit coupling , and the warping of the bands ( @xmath92 ) at higher concentrations are an important part of the quantitative numerical result .     for @xmath93 mn concentration and @xmath94 and @xmath95 , for spherical and non - spherical ( band - warping ) models.,width=326 ]    as an example , fig .\n[ sigah_x6_p4 ] shows the anomalous ac - hall conductivity of disordered system for @xmath96 % and @xmath97 and @xmath98 nm@xmath8 calculated using the 6-band model with warping ( @xmath92 ) and without warping ( @xmath99 ) , which emphasizes the importance of including the warping of the bands in obtaining reliable results which can be compared directly with experiment .\nthe hall conductivity must be non - zero in order to have non - zero magneto - optical effects , but most measurable quantities are also influenced by other elements of the conductivity tensor .\nthe most widely studied magneto - optical effects are the faraday and kerr effects .\nthe faraday effect reflects the relative difference between the optical absorption of right and left circularly polarized light , referred to as magnetic circular dichroism ( mcd ) . in the voigt geometry ( magnetization aligned with axis of light propagation ) and assuming a thin film geometry ( applicable for all ( iii , mn)v epilayers now available in the infrared regime considered here ) @xmath100 } { { \\rm re}[\\sigma_{xx}(\\omega)]}.\\ ] ] linearly polarized light propagating through a magnetic medium will experience the faraday rotation of its polarization angle and a transformation from linear to elliptically polarized light due to mcd .\nthe angle of rotation per unit length traversed , again in the thin film geometry , is ( in cgs units ) @xmath101,\\ ] ] where @xmath102 is the speed of light and @xmath27 is the index of refraction of the substrate , in this case gaas with @xmath103 .\nperhaps the more technologically relevant magneto -

recording devices .\n@xcite the behavior as a function of free carrier hole concentration can be seen in fig .\n[ faraday_x6 ] where the faraday rotation angle is shown for several carrier concentrations .\nthe peaks and valleys in the different quantities are present in all the concentrations , however the magnitude varies , even changing sign at several concentrations and frequencies .     mn concentration with @xmath109 and @xmath110 @xmath108.,width=326 ]    rather than presenting many different graphs for all the possible parameters ( @xmath111,@xmath112 , etc . ) , we direct the reader to a data - base located at http://unix12.fzu.cz/ms , where results for these quantities , together with other physical quantities , can be obtained and plotted vs. different nominal parameters.@xcite\nwe have presented a theory of the ac hall effect in the infrared regime by extending the berry s phase theory of the dc - anomalous hall effect to finite frequencies and treating the effects of disorder through a finite lifetime of the valence - band quasiparticles .\nwe observe features ( peaks and valleys ) in the transverse conductivity in the range between 200 and 400 mev at which the conductivity changes by more than 100% .\nwe have studied how these features appear in different magneto - optical effects ( mcd , faraday rotation and kerr effect ) which are relatively easily measured , finding strong signals .\nthe magnitude of the faraday rotation is very large ( one order of magnitude larger than that observed in paramagnetic ( ii , mn)vi s for example ) and has a nontrivial dependence on the free carrier concentration .\nthe kerr effect is also strong when compared to materials used in magneto - optic recording .\nthe origin of the peaks is most easily understood within a simple 4-band spherical model in which transitions between heavy and light holes states with opposite spin - polarization give the strongest contribution to the anomalous transverse optical conductivity .\nthe four band model represents the infinite spin - orbit coupling strength limit of the six - band model we use for numerical calculations .\nour use of a six - band model can account only for transitions within the valence band and not for transitions between conduction and valence bands .\nbecause of this limitation , we can not address the crossover between intra - band and interband contributions which are not completely separated in these extremely heavily - doped semiconductors , something that is clearly desirable and should be addressed in subsequent theoretical work .\nour predictions depend in intricate detail on the model that we have used to describe the ferromagnetism of these materials .\nthe model depends most essentially on the assumption that the mn impurities act as reasonably shallow acceptors and introduce @xmath2 local moment degrees of freedom to the system .\nthe specific calculations presented here assume that mn impurities and other scatterers in the system can be treated perturbatively .\nthis assumption enables quasiparticle scattering rates to be estimated in a simple way , but is a less essential part of the model .\nthe magneto - optical properties studied here are directly dependent on valence - band spin - orbit coupling , which we have argued elsewhere @xcite plays an essential role in understanding ferromagnetism in these materials .\nconfirmation by future experiment of the detailed predictions made here for the magneto - optical properties of these materials would further validate the approach we have taken to modeling these interesting new ferromagnets .\nwe expect that the weak - quasiparticle - scattering approximations made here will be more reliable in more metallic samples , since the scattering rates are then smaller compared to other relevant energy scales , particularly the fermi energy .\nwe hope that these calculations will help motivate magneto -

( values of @xmath190 are not employed in simulations . )\nmodelling gravity is a fundamental problem that must be tackled in @xmath0-body simulations of stellar systems , and satisfactory solutions require a deep understanding of the dynamical effects of softening .\nthis problem has deserved special attention both in the past ( e.g. , miller 1970 , 1976 ) and in more recent times ( e.g. , efstathiou et al .  1985 ; hernquist & katz 1989 ; pfenniger & friedli 1993 ) .\nviewed in this general perspective , our contribution has a threefold practical importance in addition to the points emphasized in sect .  1 .    1 .   the two present applications of our method reveal the dynamical differences between the most representative types of softened gravity : the isotropic p , cs and hs ( abbreviated as in sect .\n3.1 ) , and the anisotropic hos and hps ( abbreviated as in sect .\nthe major conclusions concerning their dynamical resolution , i.e.  their faithfulness in simulating the newtonian dynamics , are summarized below . 1 .\nas regards the isotropic types , the dynamical resolution is comparable .\nthis results from the fact that , even though the spatial resolution and the effectiveness in reducing noise differ significantly in p , cs and hs for the same nominal softening length @xmath1 , those differences can largely be removed by considering a more appropriate softening length of reference .\nas regards the anisotropic types , the dynamical resolution is significantly coupled parallel and perpendicular to the plane . in the plane , it decreases in quality from hps to hos , and the transition occurs in the oblate members for a softening axial ratio @xmath191 ( hps is dynamically similar to p ) .\nthese disadvantages result from the finite - sized particle implementation of softening anisotropy . on the other hand\n, they have less importance than the advantage of introducing such a degree of freedom into 3-d simulations of disc galaxies , which has been emphasized by pfenniger & friedli ( 1993 ) and in our method .\n3 .   last but not least , when employing these types of softened gravity in simulations of disc galaxies , we should recall that the dynamical resolution depends _ critically _ on two quantities : @xmath1 , or @xmath125 for a given @xmath174 , and the safronov - toomre parameter @xmath65 ( cf .\npaper i ) .\nthe choice of @xmath1 or @xmath125 should be checked vs.  the profiles of the characteristic values @xmath192 , @xmath179 and @xmath193 , which are tabulated in the applications . the choice of @xmath65 should be checked vs.  the profiles of the stability threshold @xmath66 and level @xmath194 , which can be evaluated as is explained in the method .\nour method can be applied for testing new ideas about softening .\nthere are two features that encourage such future applications\none is the _ unified _ approach adopted for investigating stability , relaxation and equilibrium . as a result , full information about the dynamical effects of softening is contained in a single quantity : the reduction factor @xmath18 .\n2 .   the other is the _ modular _ structure of the method .\nwe describe step by step how to extract detailed information concerning the dynamical properties , starting from @xmath18 and pointing out the quantities of major interest .\n3 .   but our method can be applied in another , more fruitful , way : for developing new ideas about softening . indeed , it opens a _ direct _ route to the discovery of optimal types of softened gravity for given dynamical requirements , and thus to the accomplishment of a physically consistent modelling even in the presence of a cold interstellar gaseous component\n. such a future application will be the objective of a ` twin ' paper .\nthis paper is dedicated to my parents francesco and grazia .\nit is a great pleasure to thank the referee , daniel pfenniger , whose papers about softening have represented an invaluable source of inspiration for both developing and maturing my ideas . in addition , i am very grateful to francoise combes and lars hernquist for strong encouragement and valuable suggestions on a previous draft of this paper .\ni am also very grateful to john black , daniel friedli , cathy horellou , henry kandrup , richard miller , juan muzzio , masafumi noguchi and jan palou for strong encouragement and useful discussions . the financial support of the swedish natural science research council is greatly appreciated .\n@xmath195                      aarseth s.j . , 1963 ,\nmnras 126 ,\n223 abramowitz m. , stegun i.a . , 1972 , handbook of mathematical functions  with formulas , graphs , and mathematical tables .\ndover , new york bender c.m .\n, orszag s.a . , 1978 , advanced mathematical methods for scientists and engineers .\nmcgraw -

to - date status report ) .\nthe dynamics is described in terms of transition amplitudes between states belonging to the kinematical hilbert space of lqg . in particular ,\nwhen the spin - network basis is used , the transition amplitude is a function of spins and intertwiners associated to the links and the nodes of the spin - network graph . in the recent literature @xcite , spinfoams are generally defined in terms of these variables : a space - time configuration in the spinfoam sum is understood as a @xmath0-complex with faces labeled by @xmath1-spins and edges labeled by @xmath1-intertwiners .\ndifferent representations of the hilbert space of lqg can be lifted to the covariant level in spinfoams . in this paper\nwe consider two representations for spinfoams .\nthe first is a _\nholonomy representation_. this representation allows to write spinfoams into a form closer to a feynman path - integral : as an integral over the ashtekar connection smeared along links that slice faces of the spinfoam @xmath0-complex .\nthe second is the _\nholomorphic representation _\n: it is based on the segal - bargmann transform for theories of connections introduced by ashtekar , lewandowski , marolf , mouro and thiemann @xcite .\nclearly , spinfoams in different representations have the same physical content .\nwhat the new representations provide is new insights and new calculational tools . in particular ,\nthe holomorphic representation offers a new way of understanding the semiclassical behavior of spinfoams .\nthe holomorphic representation is associated to coherent spin - network states @xcite,@xcite .\nthese states are peaked on a classical intrinsic _ and _ extrinsic discrete geometry of space .\nthis fact has a remarkable consequence that we discuss below .\nrecently , the large scale asymptotics of the @xmath2 spinfoam vertex has been derived @xcite .\nthe analysis has been done using the representation in terms of spins and normals introduced by livine and speziale @xcite . for a geometric set of boundary data , the asymptotics of the lorentzian\nvertex features a sum over two classical solutions .\nthis leads to a cosine of regge action , similarly to what happens in @xmath3d for the ponzano - regge model .\nwe argue that the presence of the second undesired classical solution in the semiclassical expansion is an artifact of the representation used : the representation in terms of spins and normals diagonalizes the area operator ; as a result , it has a maximal spread on its conjugate momentum and can not completely identify a point in phase space . on the other hand ,\nthe holomorphic representation discussed in this paper is based on coherent spin - networks .\nthese states are peaked both on the area and on its conjugate variable , an extrinsic angle .\nthis is enough to select one of the two classical solutions in the semiclassical expansion .\nthe paper is organized as follows . in section\ni we discuss the holonomy representation of spinfoams and its relation with the two representations mostly used in the literature : the ` spin and intertwiner ' representation and the ` spin and normals ' representation .\nthen , in section ii , we introduce the holomorphic representation as the segal - bargmann transform of the holonomy representation .\nmoreover we discuss the interpretation of the complex variables used in terms of discrete classical geometries . in sections\niii and iv , we derive the expression of the euclidean and the lorentzian spinfoam vertex both in the holonomy and in the holomorphic representation . in section\nv , we discuss an application of the derived formulae : we show how the peakedness on the extrinsic geometry allows to select a single classical solution in the analysis of the large scale asymptotics of the lorentzian spinfoam vertex .\nin lqg , the hilbert space associated to a graph @xmath4 embedded in a 3-dimensional hypersurface @xmath5 is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the number of links of the graph and @xmath8 the number of nodes . in the ` holonomy representation ' ,\na state is a gauge invariant function of @xmath1 group elements @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) that is invariant under @xmath1 gauge transformations at nodes , @xmath11 here @xmath12 and @xmath13 are respectively the node that is source / target of the link @xmath14 . the configuration variables @xmath15 are interpreted as holonomies of the ashtekar -

studied within loop quantum gravity @xcite .\nhowever their use in spinfoams has remained largely unexplored until recently @xcite . in the following\nwe show how coherent spin - networks and the associated holomorphic representation can be fruitfully used in the spinfoam setting .\na spinfoam vertex can be expressed in the holomorphic representation using formula ( [ eq : wpsi ] ) , @xmath78 as an example , the ponzano - regge vertex amplitude ( [ eq : pr h ] ) in the holomorphic representation is given by the following formula : @xmath79 the advantage of using the holomorphic representation is that the @xmath63 labels admit a clear interpretation in terms of classical discrete geometries . here\nwe discuss two equivalent descriptions of the discrete geometry associated to the @xmath63 variables : the first ( a ) is the one proper of canonical lqg and is due to sahlmann - thiemann - winkler @xcite , the second ( b ) is the one mostly used in the covariant spinfoam setting , it is in terms of freidel - speziale variables for twisted geometries @xcite and has been introduced by the authors in @xcite .\n\\(a ) let @xmath5 be the boundary @xmath3-manifold and choose a classical configuration of the ashtekar connection @xmath80 and its conjugate momentum , the electric field @xmath46 .\nmoreover , let @xmath81 be a cellular decomposition of @xmath5 and @xmath4 a graph dual to this decomposition .\nthe flux of the electric field through a face @xmath82 of @xmath81 determines a @xmath83 algebra element @xmath84 .\nthe holonomy of the connection along a link @xmath14 of the graph @xmath4 determines a @xmath1 group element @xmath85 .\nthe set of couples @xmath86 , one per link of the graph , determines a point in a truncation of the phase space of general relativity as captured by the graph @xmath4 .\nthe couple @xmath86 can be written as an element of the complexification of @xmath1 using the polar decomposition in front of @xmath87 is required in order to have the correct interpretation of the @xmath75 variables in terms of classical fluxes and holonomies , as a careful analysis of the expectation values of geometric operators elucidate . on the expecation values of elementary operators , see @xcite .\n] of @xmath63 : @xmath88 this is the cartan decomposition of a lorentz transformation into an @xmath1 rotation and a boost .\ncoherent spin - networks with labels as in ( [ eq : complexification ] ) are peaked on the classical configuration @xmath86 .\n\\(b ) let @xmath81 be a cellular decomposition of the boundary @xmath3-manifold @xmath5 ( the cells of the decomposition can be simplicial or even polyhedral ) .\nequip separately each cell with a euclidean @xmath3-geometry . as a result ,\nthe shape of each cell is fixed and the area and the normals to its faces can be computed .\nnow we consider two cells that share a face , and require that the area of the face is the same when seen from either of the two cells . therefore , for each face @xmath82 of @xmath81\n, we have as variables its area @xmath89 and two normals @xmath90 and @xmath91 . in general the geometry these data determine is twisted in the sense of @xcite .\na special case is the one where shared faces have congruent shapes . in this case , a continuous piecewise - flat geometry is obtained . in the case of a simplicial decomposition\n, this is a regge geometry @xcite .    besides areas and @xmath3-normals\n, there is another quantity of interest .\nlet us consider two cells sharing a face @xmath82 and think them as embedded in @xmath21-dimensional minkowski space .\nwe call @xmath92 and @xmath93 the @xmath21-normals to the two cells .\ntheir scalar product determines an angle @xmath94 with the meaning of extrinsic curvature , @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the minkowski metric .\nwe call @xmath97 the extrinsic angle times the immirzi parameter codes the rotation generated by the extrinsic curvature term @xmath98 of ashtekar - barbero connection . ]\n@xmath99 , @xmath100 summarizing , for each link of the graph @xmath4 dual to @xmath81 , we have the following set of variables :    - an area @xmath101 ,    - an _ extrinsic _ angle @xmath97 ,    - two unit - normals @xmath90 and @xmath91 .    out of these variables\nwe can build a @xmath63 element @xmath62 given by the following expression @xmath102 where the complex number @xmath103 is given in terms of @xmath97 and @xmath104 by @xmath105 and @xmath52 is the @xmath1 element associated to a vector @xmath50 as explained in the footnote@xmath106 .\nthe reason for this parametrization is that coherent spin - networks ( [ eq : coherent spin - networks ] ) with @xmath63 labels specified as in ( [ eq : hl ] ) , for large area @xmath104 reduce to superpositions over spins of livine - speziale spin - networks ( [ eq : ls spin - network ] ) @xcite .\nmoreover , the superposition over spins is a gaussian centered in @xmath107 times a phase term @xmath108 .\nthis is the superposition originally proposed by rovelli in the analysis of the graviton propagator @xcite .\nthe interpretation of the @xmath63 labels in terms of twisted geometries will be important in section v where we discuss the semiclassical behavior of spinfoams .\nthe relation between the description in terms of fluxes and holonomies ( a ) and the description in terms of areas , angles and normals ( b ) can be easily derived . writing ( [ eq : hl ] ) as the polar decomposition @xmath109 we recognize the variables used in ( [ eq : complexification ] ) , @xmath110\nthe 4d spinfoam vertex amplitude @xcite is generally defined in terms of its components on a spin - network basis . in the euclidean case , for immirzi parameter @xmath111 ,\nit is given by @xmath112 with @xmath113 , @xmath114 the @xmath115-symbol for @xmath116 and the fusion coefficients @xmath117 defined in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .\nthis representation has been used in numerical investigations @xcite . contracting it with the spin - network basis ( [ eq : spin - network ] ) leads to a rather simple integral formula for the vertex in the holonomy representation .\nlet @xmath118 be a map from the representation @xmath119 of @xmath1 to the representation @xmath120 of the euclidean group @xmath121 .\nthe map @xmath118 is such that it commutes with the diagonal action of @xmath1 on @xmath116 . in the canonical basis ,\nthe map @xmath118 is given by clebsh - gordan coefficients @xmath122 notice that @xmath123 , therefore the map @xmath118 corresponds to a projection to the highest weight representation in the tensor product @xmath124 . using this map , the vertex amplitude in the holonomy representation can be written as @xmath125 the integrals on @xmath126 impose the euclidean invariance of the vertex , and the integrand is given by a product of ` face ' terms @xmath127 given by the following distribution over @xmath128 : @xmath129 expression ( [ eq : w hl ] ) can be easily put in the holomorphic representation using the segal - bargamann transform @xcite : @xmath130 where @xmath131 notice that the last expression can be seen as a distribution on @xmath132 .\nin this section we discuss the definition of the 4d lorentzian vertex @xcite and derive its holonomy and its holomorphic representation .\nlet @xmath133 be a gauge invariant state on a graph bounding the spinfoam vertex @xmath134 the 4d lorentzian vertex amplitude for this state is obtained in two steps :    * we map the @xmath1-boundary state @xmath133 into a @xmath63-boundary state @xmath135 using a ( @xmath99 dependent ) map @xmath30 defined below ; * we impose lorentz invariance at nodes .\nthis provides a compact definition of the vertex amplitude as has to be gauge - fixed in order to avoid having a divergent expression @xcite . ]\n@xmath136 the eprl - fk vertex corresponds to a specific choice of @xmath30 defined as follows .\nlet us consider the principal series of unitary irreducible representations @xmath137 of @xmath63 @xcite with casimir operators given by @xmath138 they decompose into irreducible representations @xmath139 of a subgroup @xmath1 as @xmath140 consider the representation with labels @xmath141 , @xmath142 and let @xmath118 be the embedding of @xmath143 into the lowest weight representation of @xmath144 .\ncalling @xmath145 its canonical basis , the map @xmath118 is given by @xmath146 now we define the map @xmath147 in terms of @xmath118 as follows .\ngiven the state ( [ eq : bstate ] ) , we have @xmath148 the fact that @xmath149 is square - integrable follows easily from the ortogonality of the wigner matrices in the principal series ( on the definition and finiteness properties of @xmath75 spin - networks , see @xcite ) . using the definition ( [ eq : wvpsi]),([eq : f ] ) of the lorentzian vertex , it is easy to derive its holonomy representation .\nlet @xmath150 be the @xmath1 gauge invariant delta function on the boundary graph @xmath151 its vertex amplitude provides the holonomy representation of the lorentzian vertex .\nit is given by the following integral expression @xmath152 where the integral is over @xmath153 and the ` face ' term is @xmath154 similarly to what happens in the euclidean case .\nits segal - bargmann transform corresponds to the vertex amplitude of a coherent spin - network .\nit is given by @xmath155 where the ` face ' term now is @xmath156 we report also the ` spin and normals ' representation of the lorentzian vertex @xmath157 this expression is the one used in the analysis of the asymptotics of the vertex @xcite . in next section\nwe uncover an interesting interplay of the representations ( [ eq : lor h ] ) and ( [ eq : lor normals ] ) of the spinfoam vertex in the analysis of its semiclassical behavior .\nthe holomorphic representation is associated to a set of states that have semiclassical properties .\nthis fact makes the holomorphic representation the appropriate tool for studying the semiclassical behavior of spinfoams .\nwe illustrate this point using a simple quantum mechanical system , and then discuss it in the case of the 4d lorentzian vertex amplitude .\nlet us consider a particle on a line .\nthe evolution operator in the position representation is given by @xmath158\\;e^{\\frac{i}{\\hbar}s[x(t ) ] } , \\label{eq : w(x_1,x_2)}\\ ] ] where @xmath159 is the hamiltonian operator for the particle , @xmath160 the evolution time , and @xmath161 $ ] the classical action .\nin the formal semiclassical limit @xmath162 , the path integral in ( [ eq : w(x_1,x_2 ) ] ) is dominated by classical solutions @xmath163 starting at @xmath164 and ending at @xmath165 .\nthere can be more than a single classical solution and the stationary phase approximation of the path integral is given by a sum over all classical contributions @xcite @xmath166 here @xmath167 $ ] is the hamilton function , that is the action evaluated on one of the classical solutions .\n@xmath168 is a slowly varying function of @xmath164 and @xmath165 .\nnotice that , if we expand the hamilton function around the points @xmath169 and @xmath170 , the linear terms in the expansion are proportional to the initial and final momenta .\nin fact the derivatives of the hamilton function are @xmath171 where @xmath172 and @xmath173 are the initial and final momenta of the classical solution @xmath174 .\nthis fact has two important consequences :    * let us consider a gaussian wave packet peaked at the initial position @xmath175 and initial momentum @xmath176 , and study its evolution with the dynamics ( [ eq : w(x_1,x_2 ) ] ) . in the @xmath162 limit , only one of the terms in the sum over classical solutions in ( [ eq : h to 0 ] )\ncontributes to its evolution .\nspecifically , the term that contributes is the exponential of the hamilton function for the classical solution @xmath177 that has @xmath178 as initial conditions . * the transition amplitude to a gaussian wave packet that is peaked at a final position @xmath179 and final momentum @xmath180\nis suppressed unless these are the final position and momentum of the classical solution @xmath177 that has @xmath178 as initial conditions .\nthese two facts make the holomorphic representation especially well - suited for the analysis of the semiclassical behavior of the dynamics .\nthe holomorphic representation for a particle on a line is associated with coherent states given by the analytic continuation in @xmath181 of the heat - kernel on a line @xmath182 when @xmath181 is continued to the complex number @xmath183 , the state @xmath184 is peaked both on the position @xmath185 of the particle _ and _ on its momentum @xmath186 .\nin fact the state has a phase term @xmath187 coding the peakedness on the momentum , @xmath188 the holomorphic representation of the evolution operator is @xmath189 we call the couple @xmath190 _ classical _ if it corresponds to the boundary conditions of a classical solution @xmath177 of the dynamics . in the @xmath162 limit\n, the transition amplitude @xmath191 is maximized when the couple @xmath192 corresponds to a classical solution .\notherwise , if @xmath192 is not classical , a rapidly oscillating term @xmath193 appears in the integral ( [ eq : kwk ] ) with the effect that the transition amplitude @xmath191 is suppressed .    to summarize : the feature of the holomorphic representation is that at most one classical trajectory contributes to the semiclassical expansion of the transition amplitude .\na similar phenomenon happens in spinfoams .\n+ let us consider the lorentzian spinfoam vertex ( [ eq : lor h ] ) and focus on the case of a graph @xmath4 dual to the boundary of a @xmath21-simplex as originally done in @xcite .\nthe amplitude @xmath194 depends on ten elements of @xmath63 , one per link of the graph .\nwe can parametrize them in terms of twisted geometries using the variables @xmath195 , as explained in section ii .\nthe semiclassical limit @xmath162 corresponds to the large area asymptotics , @xmath196 . in the following ,\nwe discuss the large area asymptotics of @xmath194 .\nnotice that the large @xmath104 asymptotics of @xmath197 is proportional to the projector to the highest magnetic number @xmath198 . as shown in @xcite , a consequence of this fact\nis that the large area asymptotics of @xmath62 in the definition of coherent spin - networks reproduces a gaussian with a phase on spins , times bloch coherent states : @xmath199 when gauge invariance at nodes is imposed , bloch coherent states intertwine and reproduce livine - speziale states . as a result\n, the large area asymptotics of the spinfoam vertex in the holomorphic representation is given by the vertex in the ` spin and normals ' representation ( [ eq : lor normals ] ) , summed over spins with a gaussian weight times a phase in spins : @xmath200 now we consider the sum over spins .\nthe gaussian in the second line of ( [ eq : w = sumj ] ) is peaked on a large value of the spins , @xmath201 . as a result ,\nif we want to estimate the sum over spins , it is enough to know the large spin behavior of the quantity @xmath202 .\nthis quantity has been studied in detail by barrett - dowdall - fairbairn - hellmann - pereira @xcite .\nwe briefly recall their results .\nthey compute the large spin asyptotics of the 4d lorentzian vertex in the spins - normals representation ( [ eq : lor normals ] ) .\nthe result found is the following :    \\(i ) when the spins and the normals identify the geometry of the boundary of a @xmath21-simplex in 4d minkowski space , the asymptotics gets two contributions : @xmath203 each contribution features a rapidly oscillating phase term given by the regge action for discrete gravity @xcite , @xmath204 this is the action for a single @xmath21-simplex with faces of area @xmath205 , extrinsic angle @xmath94 , and a given choice of parity .\n\\(ii ) on the other hand , if the boundary data @xmath206 do not identify the edge lengths of a @xmath21-simplex but give only a twisted geometry , then the vertex amplitude is exponentially suppressed .    the two semiclassical contributions @xmath207 in ( [ eq : barrett ] )\ncorrespond to parity - reversed classical solutions .\nwe argue here that the appearence of a sum over classical solutions in the asymptotics of @xmath202 is exactly analogous to what happens in the simpler case discussed at the beginning of this section ( [ eq : h to 0 ] ) : it is due to the fact that the ` spin and normals ' representation does not identify a point in phase space .\nlet us see now what happens in the holomorphic representation ( [ eq : w = sumj ] ) when we use the result ( [ eq : barrett ] ) .\nour boundary data now are not just areas and normals @xmath208 , there are also the angles @xmath97 that are conjugate to the areas .\nlet us assume that the areas and the normals are compatible with the edge - lengths of a @xmath21-simplex is . ] . plugging ( [ eq : barrett ] ) into ( [ eq : w = sumj ] ) we have @xmath209 in the sum over spins there is now a rapidly oscillating phase term @xmath210 analogously to expression ( [ eq : p ] ) ,\nthe quantity @xmath211 is the momentum computed out of regge action for given boundary data : @xmath212 therefore the sum over spins is suppressed unless the variable @xmath97 in the boundary data is chosen to coincide with @xmath213 or @xmath214 . in either case , only one of the two classical solutions contributes to the semiclassical behavior of the vertex .\nin this paper we have introduced a holomorphic representation for spinfoams .\nthe 4d spinfoam vertex for gravity has a rather elegant expression in this representation : it is given by formula ( [ eq : weprl h],[eq : p h ] ) in the euclidean case and by ( [ eq : lor h],[faceterm ] ) in the lorentzian case .\nthis new representation is obtained introducing first a holonomy representation and then computing its segal - bargmann transform .\na spinfoam amplitude in the holomorphic representation is a function @xmath215 of @xmath63 elements @xmath62 , one per link of the boundary graph @xmath4 .\nthe set of variables @xmath62 describe a truncation of the phase space of general relativity as captured by the graph @xmath4 .\nthey admit a parametrization in terms of the variables generally used for describing the classical boundary geometry of a spinfoam configuration : ( i ) 3-normals to faces of a cellular decomposition of space , ( ii ) the area of faces , ( iii ) an angle associated to faces that measures the extrinsic curvature at the interface of two cells .\nthese data describe the intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of the boundary and can be coded into @xmath63 elements @xmath62 via equation ( [ eq : hl ] ) .\ntherefore , we have a description of spinfoams in terms of variables with a clear geometrical meaning\n.    the holomorphic representation of spinfoams can be fruitfully used for analyzing their semiclassical behavior . in section\nv , we focused on a spinfoam vertex in the holomorphic representation and showed that a single exponential of the regge action contributes to the large scale asymptotics .\nwhat selects one of the two exponentials appearing in the `` spin and normals '' representation is the peakedness of the boundary state on a prescribed extrinsic curvature .\nit is important to understand if this feature extends beyond the single vertex level . a way to attack\nthe problem is to derive an action in holomorphic variables following the method introduced in @xcite and then checking if a mechanism of cancellation of phases as proposed in @xcite is at work .\nfinally , we suggest a way to use the holomorphic representation to make a bridge with the hamiltonian framework .\nroughly , let us consider a holomorphic transition amplitude ( propagation kernel ) @xmath216 between an initial state labeled by complex variables @xmath217 and a final state labeled by @xmath218 .\nsuppose there is a differential operator @xmath219 acting on either the initial or the final variables which annihilates the amplitude : @xmath220 the previous equation can then be interpreted as the wheeler - dewitt equation for pure gravity satisfied by the propagation kernel in the holomorphic representation .\na recent result @xcite in the context of spinfoam cosmology shows that the holomorphic amplitude for a transition between two homogeneous metrics is , in a suitable approximation , in the kernel of a differential operator which is ( the quantization of ) the friedmann - robertson - walker hamiltonian in the absence of matter .\nwe find this result encouraging and it urges us to further explore this line of research .\nwe thank frank hellmann , roberto pereira and carlo rovelli for helpful discussions . the work of e.b . is supported by a marie curie intra -

cellular molecular transport and related traffic problems@xcite in recent years .\nmacdonald et al.@xcite initially used a tasep to simulate the dynamics of ribosomes moving along messenger rna chains .\nkruse and sekimoto@xcite proposed a two - headed tasep model to describe molecular motor traffic . in their model , each motor consists of two heads and each head is attached to a filament .\neach filament is assumed to be moveable .\nthe investigation indicates that the average relative velocity of filaments is a non - monotonic function of the concentration of motors . the density and current profiles of motors with different types of microtubule tracks ( e.g. , cylindrical geometry and radial geometry ) have been investigated by lipowsky et al.@xcite    an extension of single - lane tasep , incorporating langmuir kinetics ( lk , the attachment and detachment of particles ) , has been presented by parmeggiani et al.@xcite their model is also referred to as the pff model .\nnumerical results of the pff model show that there are unexpected stationary regimes for large but finite systems .\nsuch regimes are represented by phase coexistence in both low and high density regions , which are separated by a domain wall .\na model , incorporating a tasep , langmuir kinetics and brownian ratchet mechanism,@xcite is proposed by nishinari et al.@xcite to mimic the movement of the single - headed kinesin motor , kif1a .\na novel feature in their model is that there are _ three _ states ( strong binding , weak binding and no binding ) of a kif1a , compared to _ two _ states ( binding or unbinding ) in previous models .\ntheir model can capture explicitly the effects of adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) hydrolysis as well as the ratchet mechanism which drives individual motors .\nthe experimentally observed single molecular properties in the low - density limit are reproduced and a phase diagram is presented .    most previous work on modeling molecular motor traffic deals with single - lane systems where particles can move forward or backward , or attach and detach to a bulk ( a collection of sites in a lane except boundaries ) . obviously , the description of the traffic of motors would be more realistic if multi - lane asymmetric exclusion processes can be considered .\nexperimental observations@xcite have found that motor protein kinesins can move along parallel protofilaments of microtubules and they can jump between these protofilaments without restraint .\nrecently , pronina and kolomeisky@xcite proposed a two - lane traffic model to simulate a tasep with symmetric lane - changing rules between two lanes , but without langmuir kinetics .\nthe computational results suggest that lane - changing rates have a strong effect on the steady - state properties of the system .\nin particular , the particle current of each lane will decrease and particle densities will increase with the increase of particle coupling .\npronina and kolomeisky then extended their model to a more general case where asymmetric coupling is applied.@xcite it is found that asymmetric coupling between lanes leads to a very complex phase diagram , quite different from symmetric coupling .\nthere are seven phases in the tasep with asymmetric lane - changing rates , in contrast to three phases found in the system with symmetric coupling .\nin addition , a new maximal - current phase with a domain wall in the intermediate coupling is reported in ref.@xcite    effects of synchronization of kinks ( i.e. , domain walls ) in a two - lane tasep without langmuir kinetics is investigated by mitsudo and hayakawa.@xcite the asymmetric lane - changing rate between lanes is used . moreover ,\ndifferent injection and ejection rates of particles at the boundaries of two lanes are also considered .\nthe positions of kinks are reported to be synchronized , though the number of particles may be different on these two lanes .\nmore recently , jiang et al.@xcite introduced langmuir kinetics into one lane of a two - lane system .\nthis has shown that synchronization of shocks on both lanes occurs when the lane - changing rate exceeds a threshold .\na boundary layer is also observed at the left boundary as a finite - size effect . in their model ,\nattachment and detachment of particles are assumed to occur only on one of two lanes , not both , which is unable to realistically describe real two - lane or multi - lane molecular motor traffic .\nthis paper will investigate the collective effect of attaching and detaching particles on both lanes of a two - lane system with symmetric inter - lane coupling .\nin particular , we will focus on the finite - size effects of the system .\nthe model described in this paper is directly motivated by the dynamics of molecular motors , for instance , unidirectional motion of molecular motors along filaments,@xcite random motor ( e.g. , kinesin ) attachments and detachments to filaments,@xcite and molecular motors freely changing to adjacent filaments.@xcite it is expected that the incorporated process of a tasep , langmuir kinetics and lane - changing can shed light on the study of the traffic of molecular motors and other particle traffic in biology as well as in other areas such as vehicular traffic .    we investigate the effects of the following parameters on density and current profiles : ( i ) different lane - changing rates @xmath1 .\nwe denote @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is used to represent the number of lane - changing particles and @xmath4 is the length of each lane ( i.e. , the number of cells in each lane ) ; ( ii ) different combinations of attachment ( @xmath5 ) and detachment ( @xmath6 ) rates ( for simplicity , we assume that attachment rate @xmath7 is fixed but detachment rate @xmath8 varies ) ; and ( iii ) different system size @xmath4 , i.e. , the length of each lane . note that as we only consider symmetric lane changing , these two lanes are equivalent .\nwe compare results obtained from our model when @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( where the two - lane system becomes two separated taseps coupled with langmuir kinetics ) . in this way\n, we can more clearly distinguish the effect of different values of @xmath3 on a two - lane system .\nfinally , mean - field approximation ( mfa ) is presented and used to verify our monte carlo simulations ( mcs ) .\nthe paper is organized as follows . in section\nii , we give a description of our two - lane tasep model , considering attachment and detachment of particles in both lanes . in section iii\n, we present and discuss the results of our monte carlo simulations . in section iv ,\nmean - field approximation is presented and the quantitative agreement between the monte carlo simulations and the mean - field theory is confirmed . finally , we give our conclusions in section v.\nour model is defined in a two - lane lattice of @xmath11 sites , where @xmath4 is the length of a lane .\nwe assume that all particles move from the left to the right , as shown in fig .\n1 . sites @xmath12 = 1 and @xmath12 = @xmath4 define the left and right boundaries respectively , while a set of sites @xmath12 = 2 , ... ,\n@xmath13 is referred to as a bulk .\nparticles in the system are involved in the following processes : lane selection , particle injection into the first site of a lane , particle detachment from a bulk , particle movement along a bulk , particle lane - changing between bulks , particle attachment to a bulk , and particle ejection from the last site of a lane .\nthus , we assume that a particle that is injected to a lane and moves along the lane may be involved in the following processes :    * lane selection : a lane is randomly chosen .\n* particle injection : if the first site of the selected lane is unoccupied , a particle will be injected to the site with probability @xmath14 . *\nparticle detachment : a particle can leave the system with probability @xmath15 .\n* particle movement : if a particle can not leave the system , it can move forward to the next site in the same lane provided that the next site is empty . if the next site is not empty , the particle can not advance . in this case , the particle will check if it can change to the other lane . *\nparticle lane - changing : the particle may change to the corresponding site on the other lane with probability @xmath1 if the corresponding site on the other lane is unoccupied . *\nparticle attachment : if a site in a bulk is empty , a particle can attach to the site with probability @xmath16 . *\nparticle ejection : if a particle reaches the last site of a lane , it will be ejected from the system with probability @xmath17 .\nthe above processes can be described using the following updating rules .\nas the two lanes are equivalent , they have the same updating rules .\nwe only list the updating rules for lane 2 . an occupation variable ( @xmath18 )\ndenotes the state of the @xmath12th site in the @xmath19th lane , where @xmath20 ( or @xmath21 ) corresponds to whether the site is occupied ( or empty ) .\nthus , @xmath22 refers to the state of site @xmath12 on lane 2 .\nthe rules are :    * case @xmath23 .\n( i ) if @xmath24 , a particle enters the system with probability @xmath14 ; ( ii ) if @xmath25 and @xmath26 , then the particle in the site of @xmath27 moves into site @xmath28 ; ( iii ) if @xmath25 and @xmath29 , then the particle in the site of @xmath27 stays there .\nno lane change occurs . *\ncase @xmath30 .\nif @xmath31 , the particle leaves the system with probability @xmath17 . no lane change occurs .\n* case @xmath32 .\n( i ) if @xmath33 , the particle may leave the system with probability @xmath15 ; if it can not leave the system , it moves into site @xmath34 provided @xmath35 .\nif the particle can not advance , it may change to lane 1 with probability @xmath1 if @xmath36 ; ( ii ) if @xmath37 , a particle enters the system with probability @xmath16 .\nthese updating rules for both lanes are illustrated in fig .\n1 . for simplicity\n, we use a symmetric lane - changing rule .\nit will be the next step of our work to investigate the effects of asymmetric lane - changing rates on the dynamics of interacting particles .    normally , there are three types of updating schemes:@xcite ( i ) in parallel .\nupdating rules are synchronously applied to all sites .\na typical application is in vehicular traffic flow ; ( ii ) in ordered sequence .\npositions of particles are updated in an ordered sequential manner , e.g. , from one end to the other end of a one - dimensional system ; ( iii ) in random .\na site is randomly chosen and it is updated according to updating rules .\nhere we use a randomly sequential updating scheme , i.e. , the third scheme , which has been widely used in the simulations of molecular motor traffic.@xcite\nin this section , the results of monte carlo simulations are presented .\nthe average current ( @xmath38 ) is given by : @xmath38 = @xmath39(1 - @xmath40 .\nthe parameters are set to @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath7=@xmath46*@xmath8 . in simulations ,\nstationary profiles are obtained by averaging @xmath47 samples at each site .\nthe sampling time interval is @xmath48 .\nthe first @xmath49 time steps are discarded to let the transient time out .\nfor the special case when @xmath50 , the two - lane process is reduced to two separated processes : two one - lane tasep with langmuir kinetics .\nfeatures of a one - lane tasep with langmuir kinetics have been well studied in ref.@xcite    fig .\n2 shows average density @xmath51 and current @xmath52 of one lane of a two - lane system for different values of @xmath3 . for the special case @xmath10\n, the two - lane system reduces to two separated single - lane systems .\nwhen @xmath3 increases from 0 to 1 , we may expect the domain wall always moves in one direction ( either to the left or right ) . however , an unexpected phenomenon has been observed in our simulations : the domain wall first moves to the left slightly , and then moves towards the right with the increase of @xmath3 ( see figs .\n2(a ) and ( b ) ) .\nthis process is more clearly captured in figs .\n3(a ) and ( b ) , where the domain walls for @xmath53 are shown .\none can see that the domain wall moves to the left first when @xmath3 increases from 0 to 0.2 , and then moves towards the right when @xmath54 .\nwe refer to this feature as the _ jumping effect _ to describe the domain wall ( as well as current curve ) jump to the left and then to the right caused by the particles jumping between the two lanes .\nwe also find that there is a critical value , @xmath55 , to distinguish the movement direction of the domain wall under certain conditions .\na similar effect occurs in ref.@xcite    when @xmath7 and @xmath8 increase proportionally , the jumping effect becomes weaker ( comparing figs .\n2(a ) and ( b)with figs .\n4(a ) and ( b ) ) .\nthis implies that the jumping effect is also influenced by attachment and detachment rates .\nthe jumping effect is also observed in a larger system , e.g. , @xmath56 , ( see fig .\n5 ) when @xmath3 is small .\nit can be seen that the domain wall moves left when @xmath57 .\nwhen @xmath58 , the domain wall moves right .\nfor instance , there is an obvious movement towards right when @xmath59 ( see fig .\nthe critical value @xmath60 of @xmath3 varies with a system size , i.e. , @xmath60 changes from 0.2 to 0.3 when the system size increases from 1,000 to 10,000 .\nwe have also confirmed that the jumping effect in a two - lane homogeneous tasep coupled with langmuir kinetics is a kind of finite - size effect .\nwhen the system size is very large , e.g. , @xmath61 , in our simulations , the jumping effect almost disappears .\nwe argue that we need to study and examine finite - size effects , like the jumping effect because the size of a real system is normally not very large .\nfor example , kinesin protein motors are responsible for long - distance transport in a cell .\nthe length that a kinesin protein motor travels from its origin to its destination is normally about 100 successive steps on microtubules and the step size of kinesins is about 8nm.@xcite this indicates that a system size below 1,000 is enough to realistically describe the movements of molecular motors . even for a large system , a size @xmath62 is normally adequate for simulation .\nthus , a conclusion obtained based on the assumption of an infinite size may not be applicable to any real system .    comparing figs .\n2(a ) and ( b ) with figs .\n4(a ) and ( b ) , it can be seen that the slopes of domain walls increase with the increase of @xmath7 and @xmath8 proportionally .\nthis is because when the difference between @xmath7 and @xmath8 enlarges , more particles will attach to these two lanes rather than detach from them .\nincreasing the value of @xmath3 means more particles have chances to change to the other lane if they can not move forward along the current lane . upon further increasing @xmath3 , it is found that the density decreases , and the locations of shocks shift right slightly ( see figs .\n2(a ) and 3(a ) ) .\nwhen @xmath63 ( @xmath64 denotes the position where the density reaches maximum ) , the differences between density profiles are not obvious ( see figs . 2 and 4 )\nthis suggests that lane - changing rate @xmath3 does not have any obvious effect on the system properties ( e.g. , average density and current profiles ) after the maximum density is reached .    in figs .\n2(c ) and ( d ) , and 4(c ) and ( d ) , current profiles are illustrated .\nit is found that ( i ) the current decreases with the increase of @xmath3 until it approaches the maximum current ( @xmath65 ) .\nwhen @xmath66 is approximately equal to @xmath39 , the current @xmath67 @xmath39(1 - @xmath68 .\nthus , the maximum current @xmath69 0.25 .\nwe denote by @xmath70 the position where the current reaches the maximum ; ( ii ) when @xmath71 , the current increases when lane - changing rate @xmath3 increases ; ( iii ) when @xmath72 , the current profiles are almost the same for different @xmath3 .\nwe next investigate the effect of the values of @xmath46 ( @xmath73/@xmath8 ) on average density and current profiles .\nwe consider the situation in which @xmath7 is fixed but @xmath8 varies .\nnote that the increase of @xmath46 means the decrease of @xmath8 .\nit can be seen that average density increases with the increase of the value of @xmath46 ( see fig .\nmoreover , the shock moves left and the amplitude increases .\nin other words , the width of the transition region decreases .\nthis may be explained as follows : when the value of @xmath46 increases , the value of @xmath8 decreases proportionally , so that the opportunities for particles to detach from the bulk become smaller .\nin this case , more particles will remain in the bulk .\nthis leads to an increase of average density .    in fig .\n6(b ) , the current first increases with the increase of the value of @xmath46 till it reaches the maximum value , and then the current decreases with the increase of the value of @xmath46 . in other words ,\nthe position with the maximum current moves left and the amplitude increases ( see fig .\n6(b ) ) upon increasing @xmath46 .\nthe current curves can be obtained from equation @xmath38 = @xmath39(1 - @xmath40 , it thus can be seen that the maximum current @xmath65 = 0.25 when densities of two adjacent sites are equal to 0.5 .\nwhen density is higher or lower than 0.5 , the corresponding current is lower than 0.25 .\nfig . 7 shows the density and current profiles for different system sizes .\nit is found that the width of the transition region decreases as the number of sites is increased ( see fig .\nour simulation suggests the boundary layer shows a finite - size effect and will disappear in the limit of an infinite system . the finite - size effect shown in fig .\n7(a ) is consistent with that in refs.@xcite in fig .\n7(b ) one observes the amplitude in the left boundary enhances when the system size increases .\nin this section , a mean - field theory is developed .\nthe occupation variable ( @xmath18 ) defined in section ii is also used .\nthe corresponding equation for the evolution of particle densities @xmath74 in a bulk ( i.e. , @xmath75 can be written as    @xmath76    @xmath77    where @xmath78 denotes a statistical average .\nthe term @xmath79 is the average current from site @xmath12 in lane 1 to site @xmath12 in lane 2 , while @xmath80 is the average current from site @xmath12 in lane 2 to site @xmath12 in lane 1 .\nthe first two terms in eqs .\n( 1 ) and ( 2 ) correspond to particle movement ; the middle two terms correspond to particle lane changing , and the last two terms correspond to attachment and detachment of particles . at the boundaries , the densities evolve as @xmath81 @xmath82 where @xmath19 can be 1 or 2 .\nit can be seen that eqs .\n( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are equivalent when we use the same lane - changing rate between two lanes .\ntherefore , we only focus on the mean - field approximation in lane 2 ( i.e. , eq .\nwhen @xmath4 is large , i.e. , @xmath83 , we can transfer the coarse - grained stationary - state eq .\n( 2 ) to continuum mean - field approximation .\nfirst , we factorize correlation functions by replacing @xmath84 and @xmath85 with @xmath86 and @xmath87 , then we set @xmath88    substituting ( [ m5 ] ) into eq .\n( 2 ) , we obtain @xmath89 where @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 . the term @xmath94 is replaced by @xmath95 , and @xmath96 is approximated as @xmath97 ; similarly , the term @xmath98 is replaced by @xmath99 , and @xmath100 is approximated as @xmath101 .\nthe boundary conditions become @xmath102 and @xmath103 . as\nlane - changing is symmetric and two lanes are homogeneous , we have @xmath104 ( our monte carlo simulations show that densities in lanes 1 and 2 are the same ) . thus , eq . ( 6 )\nreduces to @xmath105    in the limit of @xmath106 , the system reaches a stationary state with @xmath107 = 0 , eq .\n( 7 ) simplifies into    @xmath108    eq .\n( [ m8 ] ) is a first order differential equation and has been solved in ref.@xcite the low - density profiles in the bulk can be obtained by integrating the equation from the left boundary @xmath109 to a density @xmath110 : @xmath111.\\ ] ] similarly , we can also integrate the equation from the right boundary @xmath112 to a density @xmath113 : @xmath114,\\ ] ] where @xmath115 .\nthe overall density profile across the system can be described by determining a shock position in these two profiles . in fig .\n8 , we compare the results of mean - field approximation ( mfa ) with the results of monte carlo simulations ( mcs ) .\nwe find that the results of monte carlo simulations are in agreement with that of mean - field approximation .\nwe note that numerical results of mcs in figs .\n8(a ) and ( b ) are almost the same as figs . 2 and 5 in ref.,@xcite which also suggests that lane - changing rate @xmath3 has no effect on density profiles of a two - lane tasep coupled with langmuir kinetics at a large attachment / detachment rate and/or a large system size .\nin this paper , two - lane totally asymmetric exclusion processes coupled with langmuir kinetics on both lanes are studied using monte carlo simulations ( mcs ) and mean - field approximation ( mfa ) .\nthe results of monte carlo simulations agree with the results of mean - field approximation . the model is directly inspired by the experimentally observed movement of molecular motors which include motor advancing along filaments , random attachment and detachment , and free jumping between filaments .    the system has mainly demonstrated the following complex behavior on two lanes .\n* the _ jumping _ effect is observed , that is , the domain wall first moves left slightly , and then move towards the right with the increase of the lane - changing rate .\nthis effect is a finite - size effect as it is not observed when the system is large , e.g. , @xmath61 .\non the other hand , increasing attachment and detachment rates proportionally will lead to the _ jumping _ effect becoming weaker . *\nafter densities reach maximum , the increase of the lane - changing rate has little effect on the system properties such as average density and current . *\nwhen @xmath7 ( attachment rate ) is fixed , it is found that average density and current increase and then the current lowers upon decreasing the value of @xmath8 ( detachment rate ) .\n* when system size @xmath4 is increased , the amplitude of the shock increases and average density increases .\n* lane - changing rate @xmath3 has almost no effect on density profiles in a two - lane tasep coupled with langmuir kinetics at a large attachment / detachment rate and/or a large system size .\nr. wang acknowledges the support of the asia : nz foundation higher education exchange program ( 2005 ) , massey university research fund ( 2005 ) , and massey university international visitor research fund ( 2007 ) .\nr. jiang acknowledges the support of national basic research program of china ( 2006cb 705500 ) , the national natural science foundation of china ( nnsfc ) under key project no .\n10532060 , project nos .\n10404025 , 10672160 and 70601026 , and the cas special foundation .\nwe are grateful to denise newth for proofreading this manuscript .", "abstract": " in this paper , we study a two - lane totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) coupled with random attachment and detachment of particles ( langmuir kinetics ) in both lanes under open boundary conditions . \n our model can describe the directed motion of molecular motors , attachment and detachment of motors , and free inter - lane transition of motors between filaments . in this paper \n , we focus on some finite - size effects of the system because normally the sizes of most real systems are finite and small ( e.g. , size @xmath0 ) . \n a special finite - size effect of the two - lane system has been observed , which is that the density wall moves left first and then move towards the right with the increase of the lane - changing rate . \n we called it the jumping effect . \n we find that increasing attachment and detachment rates will weaken the jumping effect . \n we also confirmed that when the size of the two - lane system is large enough , the jumping effect disappears , and the two - lane system has a similar density profile to a single - lane tasep coupled with langmuir kinetics . \n increasing lane - changing rates has little effect on density and current after the density reaches maximum . also , lane - changing rate has no effect on density profiles of a two - lane tasep coupled with langmuir kinetics at a large attachment / detachment rate and/or a large system size . \n mean - field approximation is presented and it agrees with our monte carlo simulations .

electron orbitals . in eqs .\n( [ eq : corecluster],[eq : valcluster ] ) the cluster amplitudes @xmath35 stand for single - particle excitations and @xmath36 for two - particle excitations , with an apparent generalization to @xmath8-fold excitation amplitudes .    dictated by the computational complexity , in most applications the cluster operator is truncated at single and double excitations ( ccsd approximation ) : @xmath37 and @xmath38 .\na further _ linearized _ ( lccsd ) approximation consists in neglecting non - linear terms in the expansion of exponent in eq.([eq : ccparamopenshell ] ) , i.e. , @xmath39    as discussed in the introduction , the cluster amplitudes can be found from solving a proper analog of the eigen -

body term @xmath56 does not have any free particle or hole lines and would not contribute to connected diagrams of @xmath43 .\none - body term will lead to dressing of particle and hole lines , discussed in section  [ sec : particlehole ] .\na part of two - body term will lead to rpa - like dressing of lccsd diagrams for matrix elements , as shown in section  [ sec : particlehole ] .\nin this section we focus on one - body term of the product @xmath0 , eq .  , and derive all - order insertions for particle and hole lines . to this end\nit is useful to explicitly express the one - body term using particle and core labels @xmath57 topologically , the first term is an object where a free hole line enters some ( possibly very complex ) structure from above and another hole line leaves below .\nthe second term has a similar structure but with particle lines . in fig .\n[ fig : dressinggeneral ] , we draw these object as rectangles with `` stumps '' indicating where the particle or hole line is to be attached . the remaining terms in eq .\nhave both particle and hole lines involved ; we will disregard these terms in the following discussion .    ]\nfirst we prove that given a certain cc diagram for matrix elements we may `` dress '' all particle and hole lines as shown in fig .  [ fig : dressinggeneral ] .\nwe start with a `` seed '' ( `` bare '' ) diagram coming from a certain set of contractions in eq .\n@xmath58 as a next step consider a subset of terms of eq .\n, constrained as @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 . in these terms\ncarry out contractions within a product of @xmath62 @xmath63 operators and @xmath64 @xmath1-operators @xmath65 within this group there are @xmath66 ways to pick out @xmath2 pairs of operators from the two sets , @xmath67 being binomial coefficient .\nonce the two strings of @xmath2 operators are chosen , there are @xmath68 possible ways to contract into pairs @xmath69 object . finally , we contract the @xmath2 resulting objects into a chain ( see fig .  [\nfig : dressinggeneral ] ) ; there are @xmath68 possible combinations . combining all these factors , we recover the original factor @xmath70 in front of the seed diagram  .\nwe may define a dressed particle - line insertion @xmath71 in fig .\n[ fig : dressinggeneral ] as @xmath72 where the subscript p - p denotes that we have to keep an insertion with a single incoming and a single outgoing particle line , e.g. , @xmath73 .\nnotice the absence of numerical factors in front of terms of the series ; this fact follows from the preceding discussion .\nexplicitly , @xmath74 this series may be generated by iteratively solving an implicit equation @xmath75 the very same argument holds for dressed insertions into the hole lines .\nthe derivation presented above can be generalized to include simultaneous dressing of _ all _ particle - hole lines of a given diagram , including the inner lines of the original `` bare '' object @xmath69 itself .\nbelow we illustrate our dressing scheme in case when the cluster operator is truncated at single and double excitations .      with the truncated cluster operator the hole - line insertion reads @xmath76 and\nthe particle - line insertion is @xmath77 where we introduced anti - symmetric quantities @xmath78 .\ndiagrammatically,@xmath79{dressed_line_skewed.eps } } \\ , .\n% + \\mathrm{exchange}%\\ ] ] as discussed in the first part of this section , we may dress all the particle / hole lines according to the all - order scheme in fig .\n[ fig : sddressedinsertions ] .    ]\nalgebraically , @xmath80 where we introduced dressed core cluster amplitudes @xmath81 we solve eq .\niteratively @xmath82 where the dressed amplitudes @xmath83 are to be computed with coefficients @xmath84 obtained at the previous step .\nwith the calculated insertions @xmath85 we can `` upgrade '' the lccsd diagrams ( compare fig .\n[ fig : zsdrepresentative ] and fig .\n[ fig : zsdrepresentativedressed ] ) . to this end\nwe introduce dressed matrix elements @xmath86 and dressed valence cluster amplitudes @xmath87 and @xmath88 , similar to eq .\n@xmath89 @xmath90 notice that the incoming valence line in the valence amplitudes @xmath91 and @xmath92 is not dressed , since it does not represent a free end . with these objects we may dress the lccsd diagrams , as shown in fig .\n[ fig : zsdrepresentativedressed ] .    .\nthe circled crosses represent line - dressed matrix elements , eq .  , and the double - lined valence cluster amplitude is the dressed amplitude , eq .  .\n[ fig : zsdrepresentativedressed ] ]    numerically , we rigorously computed the four dressed diagrams shown in fig .\n[ fig : zsdrepresentativedressed ] . in the remaining lccsd diagrams , listed in ref .\n@xcite , we have replaced the bare matrix elements with the dressed matrix elements , eq .  .\nnotice that the dressing of the hartree - fock diagram subsumes lccsd diagrams @xmath93 from ref .\n@xcite , so that these diagrams are to be discarded in the present approach .\nwe postpone discussion of numerical results until section  [ sec : numerics ] .\nin this section we continue with the systematic dressing of the coupled - cluster diagrams for matrix elements based on the topological structure of the product @xmath0 , eq .  .\nhere we focus on the two - body term of this object .\nthe insertion that generates the rpa - like chain of diagrams is due to a two - particle / two - hole part of the object @xmath94 , @xmath95 where we used a symmetry property @xmath96 , and @xmath97 .\nan analysis identical to that presented for line dressing in section  [ sec : particlehole ] leads us to introducing an rpa - dressed object @xmath98 , @xmath99 where subscript rpa specifies that the objects inside the brackets are to be contracted so that the result has the same free particle / hole ends as the original bare object @xmath100 , eq .  .\nthe sign of the leading term ( with the kronecker symbols ) is chosen in such a way that a product of this term with a particle - hole object like @xmath101 results in the original object .\na detailed consideration leads to an implicit equation for the rpa - dressed particle - hole insertion @xmath102 this equation , presented graphically in fig .\n[ fig : rpadressingeqn ] , can be solved iteratively .    , while the bare object @xmath103 is represented by a wavy line .\n[ fig : rpadressingeqn ] ]    the resulting insertion @xmath98 may dress any particle - hole vertex of a diagram as shown in fig .\n[ fig : rpadressingvertex ] .    .\n[ fig : rpadressingvertex ] ]    as an example , consider dressing of particle - hole matrix elements of operator @xmath10 : @xmath104 .\nthe equation for the dressed matrix element @xmath105 may be derived simply as @xmath106 where we used eq .   for the dressed object @xmath107 .\nfinally we obtain a set of two equations @xmath108 the resulting equations resemble the traditional rpa formulae for dressed matrix elements ( see , e.g. , ref .\n@xcite ) , but do not couple @xmath109 and @xmath110 .\nin addition , the role of the residual coulomb interaction of the traditional rpa formulae is played by the matrix elements of @xmath111 object ( that is dominated by second order in the coulomb interaction , see section  [ sec : iv ] ) .\nin addition , we would like to emphasize that the line - dressed matrix elements , eq\n.   also include matrix elements between core and virtual orbitals ; these are to be distinguished from the rpa - like matrix elements , eq .  .\nthe above derivation is only valid when dressing a single isolated vertex .\nmore complex situation arises whenever a horizontal cross - cut through a diagram produces several ( not just two , as in fig .  [ fig : rpadressingvertex ] ) unquenched particle and hole lines .\nthen the lower particle and hole lines of the object @xmath111 could be attached to the unquenched lines of the bare diagram in any order and `` cross - dressing '' may occur . as an illustration ,\nconsider rpa - dressing of the valence double contribution to the wavefunction @xmath112 .\nit arises , for example , when the diagram @xmath113 ( see fig .\n[ fig : zsdrepresentative](a ) ) is cut across horizontally .\nthe valence double contains two equivalent vertexes @xmath114 and @xmath115 .\nfirst we may attach the rpa object to the @xmath116 vertex and at the second step to the @xmath117 vertex .\napparently , this scenario is not covered by eq .\n, since it implies that all rpa insertions are attached to the same vertex .\nnevertheless , the rpa - like dressing can be carried out in a straightforward fashion . to continue with the illustration , the rpa - dressed valence double amplitude\nmay be defined as follows ( compare to eq .   )\n@xmath118 \\times \\right .\n\\nonumber \\\\ & & \\left .\n\\sum_{mna } \\rho_{mnva } a^\\dagger_m a^\\dagger_n a_a \\right)_\\mathrm{val .\ndouble } \\ , .\n\\label{eq : genrpadressvaldouble}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here subscript `` val .\ndouble '' indicates that we select a contribution having the same free ends as the r.h.s .\nof the equation .\nthe numerical factors in front of the individual rpa contributions are derived similarly to the line - dressing factors ( see section  [ sec : particlehole ] ) .\nexplicitly , we deal with a chain of diagrams @xmath119 examining the structure of the above expression we finally arrive at @xmath120 i.e. , we have demonstrated how to dress the valence doubles .\nthis example can be easily generalized to several equivalent vertexes : the eq .\nhas to be rewritten using as the seed object the underlying structure of the unquenched lines produced by a horizontal cross - cut through a diagram .\nnow we specialize our discussion of the rpa - like dressing to the cluster operator truncated at single and double excitations . in this ccsd approximation\nwe obtain for the bare rpa - like insertion @xmath121 notice that one has to be careful when dealing with the first ( singles @xmath122 singles ) term ; it is represented by a disconnected diagram and may produce undesirable disconnected diagrams for matrix elements , eq .  .\nby substituting the ccsd insertion , eq .\n, into eq .\n, we immediately derive expressions for the dressed matrix elements and the rpa - dressed valence doubles .\nfor example , @xmath123 here we omitted a small contribution to @xmath124 , eq .\n, from the product of core singles . as discussed in section  [ sec : iv ] this contribution would arise in the higher orders ( sixth order ) of mbpt .\npractically , we notice that among the dominant lccsd diagrams shown in fig .  [\nfig : zsdrepresentative ] , the particle - hole vertex occurs only in the rpa diagram @xmath125 .\nfocusing on this particular diagram , the `` upgraded '' @xmath125 is simply @xmath126 notice that the use of the rpa - dressed matrix elements to upgrade the @xmath125 diagram , such as @xmath127 does not lead to the identical result , because it misses dressing of the @xmath128 vertex .\nmoreover , we found numerically that dressing of both vertexes , as in more general eq .  , is equally important .\nfinally , it is worth noting that with the rpa - like dressing scheme proposed here , the ccsd calculations would recover the entire chain of rpa diagrams .\nhowever , if the calculations of the wavefunctions are done using the linearized version of the coupled - cluster equations ( as in refs .\n@xcite ) , a part of the rpa diagrams would still be missing  @xcite . to summarize ,\nthe inclusion of the ccsd non - linear terms in the cc equations is crucial for a fully consistent treatment of the rpa sequence .\ncoupled cluster method can be straightforwardly connected with the direct order - by - order many - body perturbation theory . in particular , for univalent systems , when the calculations are carried out starting from the frozen - core hartree - fock potential , the lowest - order contributions to the double excitation cluster amplitudes are @xmath129 here @xmath130 is the matrix element of the residual ( beyond the hf potential ) coulomb interaction between the electrons .\nit can be shown that while the lccsd method recovers all third - order diagrams for matrix elements , it starts missing diagrams in the fourth order of mbpt .\nour group has investigated these 1,648 complementary ivth order diagrams in refs .\n@xcite . among the diagrams complementary to lccsd matrix element contributions\n, there are seven terms ( class @xmath131 in ref .\n@xcite ) due to non - linear terms in the expansion of the ccsd wavefunctions .\nnamely these @xmath131 diagrams provide the lowest - order approximation for the dressing scheme proposed here .    in fig .\n[ fig : vsivthorder ] we explore the topological structure of the @xmath131 diagrams .\nall these diagrams come from various ways of lowest - order dressing of @xmath132 diagram , eq .  .\na comparison shows that the present dressing approach recovers five ( three line - dressed and two rpa - dressed ) out of seven ivth - order diagrams .\nthe missing diagrams are shown in the bottom row of fig .\n[ fig : vsivthorder ] , and we call them `` stretched '' and `` ladder '' diagrams , the names being derived from the structure of the highlighted dressing insertions . while the ladder diagram comes from the untreated two - body contribution to @xmath0 object , eq .  , the stretched diagram involves more complex _ three_-body contribution to @xmath0 .\ndressing with these two insertions can be carried out in a way similar to the line- and rpa - like dressing schemes discussed in this paper and is beyond the scope of the present analysis .\nderived in ref .\n@xcite . in these diagrams\nhorizonal lines denote coulomb interaction and the topological objects coming from the lowest - order approximation to @xmath0 are highlighted .\nthe upper three diagrams arise in the leading order of the line - dressing scheme and two diagrams in the middle are related to the rpa - dressing scheme .\n[ fig : vsivthorder ] ]    we verified that in the lowest - order mbpt approximation , eq .  , our dressing formulae reproduce the pertinent ivth - order expressions , explicitly presented in ref .  @xcite .\nfurthermore , in table  [ tab : cshfsiv ] we list numerical values for individual contributions to magnetic - dipole hyperfine structure constant ( hfs ) @xmath133 for ground state of @xmath134cs and e1 transition amplitude for the principal @xmath135 transition in cs . analyzing this table we conclude that both line and rpa  like dressing are equally important .\nmoreover , for these two particular matrix elements there is a partial cancelation between the line and rpa dressed diagrams , so that were one of the dressings omitted , the result would be misleading .\nwe also observe that the untreated `` ladder '' diagram contributes a negligibly small fraction of the total . at the same time\nthe size of the untreated `` stretched '' diagram indicates that ( at least for the hfs constant ) it is as important as the rpa - like and line - dressed diagrams .\nas to the numerics , the ivth - order calculations have been carried out using relativistic b - spline basis sets as described in ref .\nwe used a basis set of 25 out of 30 positive - energy ( @xmath136 ) pseudo - eigenfunctions for each partial wave .\npartial waves @xmath137 were included in the basis .\nthe summation over intermediate core orbitals was limited to eight highest energy core orbitals for the e1 amplitude and included all core orbitals for the hfs constant .\nthe reader is referred to paper  @xcite for a description of our ivth -

like dressing of the coupled - cluster diagrams for matrix elements .\nfurther , we reduced our general formalism to the case when the cluster operator is truncated at single and double excitation amplitudes .\nwe have also verified that in the lowest order we recover the relevant fourth - order diagrams both analytically and numerically . in this section\nwe illustrate our all - order dressing formalism with numerical results .    we have carried out relativistic calculations of the hyperfine - structure ( hfs ) constant @xmath133 for the @xmath142 state and @xmath4 electric - dipole transition amplitude for @xmath134cs atom .\nit is worth noting that matrix elements of hyperfine interaction and electric dipole operator allow one to access the quality of _ ab initio _ wavefunctions both close to the nucleus and at intermediate values of electronic coordinate .\nsuch a test is essential for estimates of theoretical uncertainties of calculations of parity - nonconserving ( pnc ) amplitudes .\nthe _ ab initio _ pnc amplitudes are key for high - accuracy probes of new physics beyond the standard model of elementary particles with atomic parity violation .\nthe results of calculations are presented in tables  [ tab : hfssummary ] and  [ tab : dsummary ] . in these tables\nwe augment results of the previous all -

doubles equation ( lccsdpt method ) .\nthe main consequence of this perturbative treatment is that the resulting valence removal energies are complete through the third order of perturbation energies .\nthere is also a substantial ( a few per cent for cs ) improvement in the accuracy of the resulting lccsdpt hyperfine constants over the lccsd values . at the same time\nthe theory - experiment agreement for the e1 amplitudes significantly degrades ( see table  [ tab : dsummary ] ) : while the lccsd amplitudes differ by 0.4% from 0.03%-accurate experimental data  @xcite , the more sophisticated lccsdpt matrix elements deviate from measurements by as much as 1.3% . in other words ,\nboth lccsd and lccsdpt methods are poorly suited for calculating parity - non - conserving ( pnc ) amplitudes in @xmath134cs with uncertainty of a few 0.1% .\nit is one of the goals of this paper to establish a method that would provide a consistent accuracy for both hfs constants and dipole matrix elements ( and thus pnc amplitudes ) .\n_ procedure .\n_ first we solved the relativistic lccsdpt equations , as described in ref .\n@xcite . with the computed cluster amplitudes we calculated lccsdpt matrix elements and recovered results published in ref .\nfurther , we solved the line - dressing equations   and computed the line - dressed cluster amplitudes and matrix elements .\nthe convergence rate was fast : four iterations were sufficient to stabilize the norms of the line - dressed cluster amplitudes at a level of a few parts per million .\nfinally , we solved the iterative equation for the rpa - dressed valence amplitudes , eq .. it turned out to be very computationally intensive part of the scheme and we iterated the equations only once .\nwe used the computed rpa - dressed valence amplitudes in calculations of the dominant diagram @xmath113 , see eq .  .\nin the remaining diagrams that involve particle - hole matrix elements , we employed rpa - dressed matrix elements @xmath146 . a numerical iterative solution of equations for @xmath146 , eq .\nrequired only a few iterations to converge to seven significant figures .\n_ line dressing .\n_ in table  [ tab : cslinedress ] we illustrate the importance of line dressing ; in this table we present differences between line - dressed and bare lccsdpt diagrams for the the hyperfine constant and e1 amplitude .\nthe dressing of the leading order hf diagram subsumes the lccsd diagrams @xmath147 and @xmath148 , eq .  . a direct calculation of these diagrams results in @xmath149 mhz for @xmath3 and @xmath150 a.u\n. for the e1 amplitude .\nthese values are consistent with dressing - induced modifications of the hf diagram ( @xmath151 mhz and @xmath152 a.u . , respectively ) from table  [ tab : cslinedress ] .\nthe modifications of the @xmath132 diagram are consistent with the values of the pertinent fourth - order diagrams , see section  [ sec : iv ] and table  [ tab : cshfsiv ] . a large dressing correction for hfs\nconstant comes from the diagram @xmath153 ; it is nominally a fifth - order diagram .\nthe relative importance of this diagram is not surprising since it is based upon brueckner orbitals ( self - energy or core polarization effect ) . as for the e1 amplitude ,\nthe line - dressing correction is dominated by @xmath132 ; i.e. , it is dominated by the fourth - order contribution . for the hfs constant\n, a relative smallness of the line - dressing correction to @xmath132 diagram arises due to a delicate cancelation of relatively large contributions from dressing of the core , particle and valence lines of the diagram ( see table  [ tab : cshfsiv ] ) .\nfinally , in the bottom line of the table  [ tab : cslinedress ] we present a difference between the line - dressed ( all diagrams ) and bare values .\nthe dressing of the hf diagram plays a negligible role here , since it is dominated by the diagrams already included in the lccsdpt values .\nthe line dressing contributes at a sizable 0.5% level to the hfs constant and at 0.2% level to the e1 amplitude .\nldd type & & + @xmath154 & -22 & -1.7[-3 ] + @xmath132 & 0.04 & 9.3[-3 ] + @xmath153 & -8.6 & -0.5[-3 ] + @xmath155 & -0.8 & -3.6[-5 ] + all diagrams & -11 & 8.0[-3 ] +    _ rpa -

order approximation to our all - order dressing scheme . in tables\n[ tab : hfssummary ] and  [ tab : dsummary ] we added the contributions of untreated `` stretched '' and `` ladder '' diagrams of the @xmath170 class and also from @xmath171 class . the latter contribution would have been accounted for by solving the full ( not linearized ) cc equations . in our large - scale fourth - order calculations\nwe have employed the code described in ref .\n@xcite ; all the formulas for a large number of diagrams and the code have been generated automatically using symbolic algebra tools .\nwhile the resulting fourth - order corrections from triples are at the level of 1% , we notice that there are certain noticeable cancelations between various diagrams .\nthus a complete all - order treatment of triples would be essential for attaining the next level of theoretical accuracy .\n_ hyperfine constant results .\n_ details of calculation of the hyperfine constant @xmath172 are presented in table  [ tab : hfssummary ] . to clarify the role of correlations ,\nwe first incorporate a number of small but important effects into the reference value : bohr - weiskopf effect , breit and radiative corrections .\nthe `` lccsdpt , coulomb '' value has been computed using the finite nuclear size , both for determination of wavefunctions and computing matrix elements of hyperfine interaction ( this accounts for 0.5% . )\nwe also include breit corrections from ref .\n@xcite ; these corrections differ substantially from those incorporated in ref .\n@xcite due to order - of - magnitude important correlation corrections . finally , radiative corrections to magnetic - dipole hyperfine - structure constants for the ground state of alkali - metal atoms were computed recently by @xcite .\nthey found that the vacuum polarization and self - energy ( vp+se ) contribute as much as 0.4% to the _ ab initio _ value .\nthe reader should be careful with adopting breit values from ref.@xcite , because these values do not include correlation corrections ( see ref .\n@xcite and references therein ) .\nthe final value , marked as `` lccsdpt reference '' deviates by 0.9% from ( exact ) experimental value .    dressing corrections partially cancel , resulting in 0.3% total dressing contribution .\nfourth - order diagrams , complementary to those already included in the lccsdpt value are dominated by a contribution due to triple excitations ( 0.8% ) .\nwe also include the `` stretched '' and  ladder \" iv - order diagrams missed by our dressing scheme ( see section  [ sec : iv ] ) .\nalmost all the correlation corrections are of similar sizes but of different signs , so the dressing and iv - th order corrections cancel , so that the final correlation correction is only 0.1% , just slightly improving the theory - experiment agreement when compared with the `` lccsdpt reference '' value . our _ ab initio _\nvalue for the hfs constant deviates by 0.8% from the experimental value .    _\nelectric - dipole @xmath4 transition amplitude . _\ndetails of calculation for the dipole matrix element are compiled in table  [ tab : dsummary ] .\nwe do not include breit and radiative corrections in that table , since the breit interaction contributes only 0.02% to this matrix element  @xcite , and radiative corrections are not known from the literature .\nthere were several high - accuracy experimental determinations of @xmath173 matrix element .\nwe list these matrix elements in the bottom of table  [ tab : dsummary ] . in refs .\n@xcite this matrix element has been extracted from the measured lifetime of the @xmath174 state .\ndetermination of ref .\n@xcite is based on photoassociative spectroscopy of cold cs atoms ( i.e. , inferred from high - accuracy measurement of molecular potentials ) .\nanother approach to extraction of dipole matrix elements has been proposed by us in ref .\n@xcite : we exploited an enhanced sensitivity of static electric - dipole polarizability @xmath175 of the ground state and van der waals coefficient @xmath176 of the ground molecular state to the matrix elements of principal transitions @xmath177 and @xmath173 .\nessential to the extraction of individual matrix elements was a high - accuracy ratio of these two dipole matrix elements measured in ref .\n@xcite . based on the proposed method  @xcite\n, the @xmath173 matrix element has been deduced from high - accuracy @xmath176 in ref .\n@xcite and in ref .\n@xcite it has been inferred from @xmath175 measured in that work .\nthe most accurate matrix element comes from photoassociation spectroscopy  @xcite ; their result has 0.03% accuracy and we will use that value below for calibrating _ ab initio _ calculations .\nthe reference lccsdpt e1 matrix element deviates from high - accuracy measurements by as much as 1.3% .\nthe correlation corrections ( dressing and fourth - order ) computed by us improve the agreement to about 0.6% , i.e. , the _ ab initio _ accuracy becomes comparable to that for the hfs constant .\nan analysis of table  [ tab : dsummary ] shows that due to cancelation of line- and rpa - like - dressing corrections the overall effect of dressing is negligible for this transition amplitude . at the same time , the forth - order corrections due to triple excitations beyond lccsdpt triples are very large , almost 1% .\nthere corrections due to residual fourth - order rpa corrections ( @xmath178 ) are also sizable , and tend to decrease the effect of triples .\nour forth - order calculation demonstrates that a full ( beyond that of lccsdpt ) treatment of triple excitations improves the accuracy of _ ab initio _ transition amplitudes .\nthe main two results of this work are : ( i ) development and application of all - order dressing formalism for matrix elements computed with coupled - cluster method ; ( ii ) first calculations of matrix elements for cs complete through the fourth order of many - body perturbation theory .    to reiterate ,\nour dressing formalism is built upon a hierarchical expansion of the product of clusters @xmath0 into a sum of @xmath2-body insertions .\nwe considered two types of insertions : particle / hole line insertion coming from the one - body part of the product and two - particle / two - hole rpa - like insertion due to the two - body part .\nwe demonstrated how to `` dress '' these insertions and formulated iterative equations .\nparticular attention has been paid to the singles - doubles truncation of the full cluster operator and we derived the dressing equations for this popular approximation .\nwe have upgraded coupled - cluster diagrams for matrix elements with the dressed insertions for univalent systems and highlighted a relation to pertinent fourth - order diagrams .\nfinally , we illustrated our formalism with relativistic calculations for cs atom .\nour relativistic calculations also include a large number of fourth - order diagrams complementary to lccsdpt method ( linearized coupled - cluster single - doubles method with perturbative treatment of triples ; it is the most sophisticated cc approximation applied in relativistic calculations for cs so far ) .\nthe resulting analysis is complete through the fourth - order of many - body perturbation theory .\nwe find that these complementary diagrams substantially improve the theory - experiment agreement for an important electric - dipole @xmath4 transition amplitude , and slightly better the agreement for the hyperfine constant .\nwe found sizable cancelations between various fourth - order contributions ; a full all - order treatment of triple and disconnected quadruple excitations is desirable to further improve the theoretical accuracy .", "abstract": " we consider evaluation of matrix elements with the coupled -
