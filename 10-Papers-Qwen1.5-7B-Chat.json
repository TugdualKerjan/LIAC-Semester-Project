Reductive eliminations involving fluoroalkyl groups have been demonstrated at higher valent states of nickel,[1, 2, 3, 4] the generation of fluoroalkyl radicals via electron transfer or atom abstraction reactions of fluoroalkyl electrophiles with nickel is known,[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] fluoroalkyl-based transmetalating reagents readily react with nickel,[13, 14, 15] and catalytic transformations involving select fluoroalkyl groups have been reported.[16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 10, 22, 6] Nickel is also an earth-abundant metal with a reasonably low cost. However, most of the aforementioned chemical transformations involving fluoroalkyl groups required nickel to bear stabilizing ligands other than solvent. While in many cases ligands can serve to tune and enable the reactivity of a nickel center, in other cases they can prevent catalysis through redistributions that affect the speciation of an active form of the nickel catalyst. Moreover, extraneous non-solvento ligands raise the cost of a chemical process and can even contribute to the air-sensitivity of the system. Given these considerations, we became interested in developing new fluoroalkylation methods with nickel that employed solvent as theonly coordinating ligand. Such reaction conditions have commonly been referred to as \"ligandless\" conditions in other systems.[22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]",

These results clearly show that upon oxidation of acetonitrile-supported nickel fluoroalkyl complexes, the fluoroalkyl groups can be transferred to organic substrates. Secondly, the electrochemical analysis of [(MeCN)Ni\\({}^{\\dagger}\\)(C\\({}_{2}\\)F\\({}_{5}\\))\\({}_{3}\\)]\\({}^{-}\\) suggests that, upon electro-oxidation to [(MeCN)\\({}_{n}\\)Ni\\({}^{\\dagger\\#}\\)(C\\({}_{2}\\)F\\({}_{5}\\))\\({}_{3}\\)], reductive hemolysis of a perfluoroethyl radical occurs, with the concomitant formation of [(MeCN)Ni\\({}^{\\dagger\\#}\\)(C\\({}_{2}\\)F\\({}_{5}\\))\\({}_{2}\\)]. This electrochemical behavior shows generality with trifluoromethyl derivatives.[29] Lastly, catalytic C-H trifluoromethylations of electron rich arenes were successfully achieved using either [(MeCN)Ni(CF\\({}_{3}\\))\\({}_{3}\\)]\\({}^{-}\\) or the related [Ni(CF\\({}_{3}\\))\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2-}\\).

The covalency was analyzed, on one hand, by changes in the concentration of the electron density at the BCP along with changes in the delocalization indices. On the other hand, energy densities show the polarization of the covalent bond by looking at the ratios between potential [V(r)] and kinetic [G(r)] energy densities, which for partial covalent bonds lie in between values of 1 and 2. The total energy density shows the degree of covalency that is represented by the level of predominance of the potential over the kinetic energy density [42].",

Fortunately, crosslinked dynamers, also referred to as covalent adaptable networks or vitrimers, have been developed by replacing covalent bonds with dynamic counterparts, therefore allowing constitutional structural adjustments in the polymer matrices [37, 49, 50, 51, 52]. Thanks to this, network dynamers can be easilyreprogrammed and recycled through reversible reactions, such as imine and hydrazome formation and exchange [19, 24, 53, 54].

The fluidic network patterned into the device splits a single sample inlet into separate and ultimately opposing channels. Analytes can undergo partial reactions with unique reagents stored in each channel. The products of these partial reactions are directed towards a common test zone. Others have shown paper devices designed for the sequential, timed delivery of reagents from multiple channels that are directed towards a test zone.[38, 39] In these devices, flow is continuous as long as sufficient volume is available to saturate the paper. Because paper-based devices are inherently self-metering,[5] if a single channel is split and recombined, net fluid flow stops when the advancing fluid fronts meet. At this interface between fronts, where reactions between previously separated reagents are now possible and controlled by diffusion, assay products can be isolated without affinity-based capture and lead to the formation of colorimetric signals that are confined to the contour of the interface. Using this device design strategy, we demonstrate the detection of multiple classes of analytes--ions, small molecules, and enzymes--by producing line-format signals like those provided by LFTs but resulting from soluble reaction products.

Additionally, we demonstrate the scalability of this method by increasing the number of fluid fronts that converge in a common detection zone to create multiplexed assays: two converging channels create one interface (i.e., singleplex) while three or four converging channels create three or four interfaces, respectively (i.e., multiplex). We demonstrate the ability to create multiple lines in common zone by combining test and control assays for both iron (III) and acetylcholinesteraseiesterase. Overall, these devices provide a new method of generating user-friendly signal formats for analytes that are currently incompatible with molecular recognition-style assay architectures.",

We made it so many times, even with more than one channel, to show it works well for lots of tests at once. These paper helpers can make colorful patterns without needing fancy stuff, making it easy for everyone to understand."

For assays that require reagents with different chemical properties (e.g., solubility, rehydration rate, or interactions with the surrounding paper matrix) to be stored on opposite sides of the device, channel lengths may be adjusted to provide timed convergence of liquid fronts at the desired location [11, 41]. This approach is shown in Figure S1A, in which an interface formed between two solutions of colored dyes was shifted from the center of the device detection zone using an asymmetrical channel geometry. Additionally, the position of the formed interface is dependent on the geometries of patterned paper layer features and proper layer alignment [42, 43]. We developed a layer alignment pin tool and protocol to position device features reproducibly and ensure the interface position is only dependent on synchronized delivery of fluid fronts to the detection zone (Figure S2). This approach consistently provides interfaces at the center of device detection zones (Figure S1B). In the assays described below, a symmetrical channel design reproducibly afforded interfaces in the center of the test zone.",

In these interface-forming devices, however, detection zones are not in direct, vertical fluidic connection with patterned features on the previous layer. To enhance the contrast between colorimetric signal at liquid interfaces and the surrounding paper matrix, we altered our device design to include a patterned paper zone in the center of the reagent storage layer (Table S1) that is separate from the fluidic pathway of the assay and stays dry.",

Upon introduction of the sample, a partial reaction occurs in the channel containing analyte-specific reagents.

The time required to generate visible signals can vary based on the grade of paper used to fabricate the device (Table S2). We used Whatman 4 for all layers of our paper-based device and observed that signal formation starts at approximately 2 minutes. Products accumulate over time and cause an increase in signal intensity, until saturating at approximately 7 minutes after the sample was added (Figure 2A). Additionally, the gradual increase in signal intensity causes nearly linear broadening of the width of the formed interface over time, which eventually compromises signal intensity. Therefore, we determined the ideal signal read time is between 7-10 minutes, with the cut off time for signal interpretation to be 20 minutes. Prior to the cut off time, the signal intensity is at a maximum value and can be used for qualitative detection, which we demonstrate with Fe(III) ions (Figure 2B).

To detect Fe(III), we stored ascorbic acid (a reducing agent) and 3-(2-pyridyl)-5,6-diphenyl-1,2,4-triazine-p,p'-disulfonic acid (Ferrozine; a colorimetric indicator of Fe(II))[46] in opposite channels of the reagent storage layer (Figure 3A).

If Fe(III) is present in the sample, it will be reduced to Fe(II) in the channel containing ascorbic acid, while no reactions will occur in the channel containing Ferrozine. When the two wicking fronts converge at the detection zone on the bottom layer of the device, reduced Fe(II) is chelated by Ferrozine and forms a purple signal at the formed interface (Figure 3B, Figure S4).",

This color, a reaction product with Ferrozine, could be caused by Fe(II) impurities in either the Fe(III) sample or the paper[47]. We minimized the background signal by incorporating ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) in the Ferrozine side of the sample distribution layer[48]. We tested both the effect of different EDTA and Ferrozine concentrations on the signal to background ratio (Table S3, Table S4). As the concentration of Ferrozine increased, the intensities of both the signal formed at the readout zone and the background increased. The increase in background intensity did not negatively impact the signal to background ratio, which increased proportionally with the concentration of Ferrozine. However, the increase in signal to background ratio in the presence of EDTA was higher than that without using EDTA, which further suggests that the incorporation of EDTA provided superior results (Table S3, Table S4).",

AChE hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into choline and acetic acid to terminate neurotransmission at the cholinergic synapse. Inhibition of AChE by organophosphates, heavy metals, or chemical warfare agents can block acetylcholine transmission and lead to organ failure and death [50]. We chose AChE as a model analyte to evaluate how interfaces were formed when reactions were governed by two time-dependent processes: (i) the activity of the enzyme (i.e., the analyte) and (ii) diffusion and mixing of reactants across the interface. To detect AChE, we stored acetylcholine chloride and 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB, Ellman's reagent) on opposite sides of the reagent storage layer (Figure S6). When AChE is present in the added sample, it reacts with acetylcholine to produce acetic acid and thiocholine (Figure 4A). At the interface, the unmasked sulfhydryl group on the thiocholine interacts with DTNB to generate 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoic acid and form a yellow signal that we could quantify with image analysis. As expected for an enzymatic assay, the signal intensities saturated over time. Similar to the Fe(III) assay, signal from AChE assay took approximately two minutes to start forming and increased in width and intensity over time. To ensure color saturation, we used the scans taken 10 minutes after sample addition to analyze the signal intensity formed at the interface. We performed nonlinear regression of the data using a saturation growth model for concentrations of AChE ranging from 2-30 U/mL (Figure 4B). From the fit, we determined that there was a nearly linear relationship between the concentration of AChE and measured signal between 2-10 U/mL, and signals at higher concentrations were saturated and could be detected but not quantified. While the physiological range of AChE in plasma is greater than 8 U/mL [51], exposure to dangerous chemical agents (e.g., organophosphates) results in a reduction of AChE activity into the linear range of this assay. While it can be hard to detect yellow lines on white backgrounds with the naked eye, especially at lower analyte concentrations, this AChE assay remains useful to provide a visual reference for qualitative detection (i.e., \"yes or no\" presence of analyte).

While exercising, undesired lactate accumulation in the active muscle can manifest as fatigue, soreness, and pain[52]. Also, sweat lactate can provide information about insufficient oxidative metabolism and pressure ischemia[53]. We chose lactate as a model analyte to demonstrate how the device can accommodate multistep reactions. To detect lactate, we stored (i) nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and (ii) 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolzolium bromide (MTT) on opposite sides of the second layer of the device (Figure 5A). Then on the third layer, we again stored NAD+/LDH below the first treated layer and phenazine methosulfate (PMS) below MTT (Figure S7). When a sample containing lactate is introduced and split by the sample distribution layer, the following reactions occur: (i) LDH converts lactate to pyruvate and (ii) transfers the liberated hydride ion to the co-stored NAD+ to produce NADH. In the other channel, both MTT and PMS are simply rehydrated.

The addition of hydrazine buffer on the fourth layer of the device was to neutralize the co-produced pyruvate (Figure S7)[54]. For the lactate assay, the detected concentration range was 2-50 mM (Figure 5B). Unlike Fe(lll) and AChE assays, we analyzed results of lactate assay approximately 4 minutes after sample addition to avoid increased background signal over time. The high noise is likely due to both MTT and PMS reagents causing a yellow background color. Since the assay involves enzymatic reactions, we analyzed the results by nonlinear regression using a growth and saturation model. The data showed a nearly linear relationship between signal intensity (green channel) at concentrations of lactate less than 20 mM. At higher concentrations of lactate, the signal saturated and resulted in detectable but not quantifiable signal (Figure 5C).

These MOFs were synthesized using 0.5, 1, and 1.5 oxalic acid:Al ratios to study how the amount of modulator affects the crystallinity of the products. In all the studied systems, oxalic acid leads to an increased crystal size with respect to the unmodulated synthesis (Figure 2, Figures S9-S23). Interestingly, a higher modulator-to-Al ratio does not always result in improved crystallinity. Indeed, in the cases of OH- and CH\\({}_{3}\\)O-MIL-53, an excessive amount of modulator leads to the stabilisation of a specific size or the absence of solid products, respectively. This behaviour can be attributed to the electron-donor character of OH and CH\\({}_{3}\\)O groups[45], which lowers the acidity of terephthalatic acid by destabilising its conjugated base[46]. Additionally, the pH decrease due to the MOF synthesis and to the formation of aluminium oxalate complexes further disfavours the deprotonation of the linkers, thus diminishing their reactivity. Our results show that the combination of these effects can allow for the tuning of the product's size distribution, in addition to its crystallinity. However, to achieve such control several aspects should be considered, in particular the modulator concentration, the species formed during the synthesis, and the chemical properties of the linker. Therefore, the adequate conditions to stabilize a specific size must be optimised for every system.",

The XRPD patterns of all NO\\({}_{2}\\)-MIL-53 products (Figure S48) show broad diffuse scattering bands, also observed by SCXRD (Figure S56). These signals are attributable to a local ordering of the NO\\({}_{2}\\) groups, which can be found disordered in four equivalent positions for every linker after the MOF assembly. The effect of the modulator in slowing the crystal growth can favour this ordering and allow the formation of larger ordered domains, which could grow clustered in polycrystalline aggregates like those observed by SEM for the products obtained with the highest modulator concentration. Further experiments to confirm this hypothesis and determine the ordering of the NO\\({}_{2}\\) groups will be the focus of our future research.",

Although the outcome of this approach is highly dependent on the framework's structure as well as on the synthetic conditions, its efficacy has been confirmed for all the examined systems regardless of linker functionalisation or type of material. We attribute this remarkable versatility to oxalic acid's synergistic action in both binding the metals and protonating the linkers, thus introducing a substantial control over the MOF nucleation and regulating the crystal growth. Furthermore, we described how the strong differences between its characteristic five-membered ring chelation and the linker's coordination mode in the studied materials allow the modulating function without causing substitutional defects. These advantages do not apply in the case of modulators whose coordination capabilities are compatible with those found in the IBUs, such as fluoride or monocarboxylate species. Further applications of oxalic acid modulation to other AI-MOFs, as well as frameworks based on different metals, will be crucial to assess more thoroughly its validity and highlight additional MOF-specific particularities and advantages associated with its use.",

The model presented here indicates spin-phonon coupling terms are governed by the magnitude of the metal-based spin-orbit coupling (SOC) constant, excited state mixing of orbital angular momentum into the ground state, and dynamic relativistic nephelaavetic contributions. The latter contribution is directly related to the covalencies of ligand-metal bonds and can modify the metal-based SOC constant from that of the free ion in a dynamic manner. Also, correlations between dynamic ground state orbital angular momentum and excited state coupling terms and their relations to spin-phonon coupling terms are drawn for the first time. Specific group theoretical correlations between high and lower symmetry point groups further provide a means to evaluate spin-phonon coupling terms across transition metal complexes and molecular qubits featuring different ligand sets, geometries, and coordination numbers. The model is in excellent agreement with a wide range of experimental quantum coherence properties of Cu(II)- and V(IV)-based molecular qubits and therefore provides a means to rapidly evaluate spin-phonon coupling terms in any \\(\\mathrm{S=\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}}\\) transition metal complex, including new qubit candidates.",

This is anticipated to be especially important for local mode contributions to decoherence, as the \\(a_{I}\\)_(1)_ mode is the lowest energy mode in these structures and thus can become populated at relatively low temperatures. Indeed, all Cu(II)-based qubits in the literature are roughly square planar, \\(D_{4h}\\). Insightful and quantitative comparisons can be drawn between the vibrational analyses of the total symmetric breathing modes of the \\(D_{4h}\\) and \\(D_{2d}\\) structures, with the latter exhibiting a larger spin-phonon coupling term. This larger coupling term occurs even though the excited state coupling term (Figure 4a) is larger than the \\(D_{2d}\\) structure. The activation of the \\(a_{I}\\)_(1)_ mode for the \\(D_{2d}\\) structure and its excited state coupling behavior can be understood via the qualitative potential energy surfaces in Figure 4b. Given the ground state structure of [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- in the absence of any structural constraints is \\(D_{2d}\\), going to the \\(D_{4h}\\) structure on the ground state surfaces results in a scenario where there is a relatively small gradient in the excited state potential energy surfaces.

The \\(a_{I}\\)_(1)_ mode can be described by the Cl-Cu-Cl bond angle, \\(\\alpha\\), while the \\(a_{I}\\)_(2)_ mode can be described by the Cu-Cl bond distance.

The horizontal and vertical components of the arrows reflect the relative contributions to the \\(a_{I}\\)_(2)_ and \\(a_{I}\\)_(1)_ modes, respectively.

            "input_text": "Above, we have outlined a general LFT model of spin-phonon coupling terms in S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) transition metal complexes. This model is derived from the first and second derivatives of the LFT expressions of g-values given in Section 2.1[54]. While these expressions define the zero temperature magnitudes of spin-phonon coupling terms in S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) complexes, they can be expanded to consider additional dynamic effects through the variance of g\\({}_{z}\\), \\(\\langle g_{z}^{2}\\rangle\\), which highlights the importance of the first derivative, \\(\\frac{\\partial g_{z}}{\\partial q_{l}}\\), and therefore its role in the coherence lifetimes of S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) transition metal complexes. This suggests that, without considering thermal population, odd modes such as totally symmetric stretches will have a more substantial effect on spin-phonon coupling terms and decoherence compared to even modes, in which their value of relevance, \\(\\frac{\\partial^{2}g_{z}}{\\partial q_{l}^{2}}\\), only appears in the second order term of the Taylor expansion (equation 5). The fundamental behavior of these expressions were borne out by an extensive range of DFT and TD-DFT calculations on minimalistic S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) models, \\(D_{4h}\\)/\\(D_{2d}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- and \\(C_{\\mathcal{H}}\\) [VOCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)-. Together, the results above provide a general description of the roles of transition metal geometric and electronic structure in spin-phonon coupling. For instance, the magnitudes of spin-phonon coupling terms are strongly influenced by excited state SOC of orbital angular momentum into the ground state and are predicted to be strongly influenced by the energy of the particular ligand field excited state mixing with the ground state (equations 6 and 7) (e.g., \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{2g}\\) for a \\({}^{2}\\)B\\({}_{1g}\\) ground state in \\(D_{4h}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)-). This excited state SOC contribution is governed by the ligand field geometry about the metal complex. For example, going from \\(D_{4h}\\) to \\(D_{2d}\\) [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- turns on additional mode coupling terms due to the enhancement of excited state coupling terms (Figure 4). Furthermore, the magnitude of spin-phonon coupling terms are strongly influenced by the covalency of ligand-metal bonds. This dynamic effect largely reflects a relativistic nephelauxetic effect, which effectively modulates the SOC constant of the metal from that of the free ion. In short, the more covalent the ligand-metal bond, the smaller the spin-phonon coupling terms become. Relatedly, a significant overall reduction in SOC constant can of course be achieved through the use of different transition metal complexes (e.g., V(IV) vs. Cu(II) vs. Cr(V)). As shown below, V(IV), which has a significantly lower SOC constant than Cu(II), can still maintain favorable spin-phonon coupling terms despite having significantly more ionic ligand-metal bonds than Cu(II) complexes. Complications can also arise from trying to quantify spin-phonon coupling terms in different ligand field environments, as the nature of the modes can change. However, this can be facilitated to some degree by leveraging specific group theoretical correlations as demonstrated here for \\(D_{4h}\\), \\(D_{2d}\\), and \\(C_{\\mathcal{H}}\\) transition metal complexes. The spin-phonon analyses presented above for [CuCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- and [VOCl\\({}_{4}\\)]\\({}^{2}\\)- are now extended to a range of S = \\(\\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}\\) Cu(II) and V(IV) molecular qubit candidates.",

From Table 5, this is largely reflected by the lower excited state energy (22305 cm\\({}^{-1}\\)) (and thus the higher amount of ground state orbital angular momentum) and, to a smaller extent, the lower covalency (42 % Cu(d)). The slopes and coefficients for CuPc are increased further relative to the other Cu(II) complexes, as the Cu-N bonds are significantly more ionic than the Cu-S bonds of Cu(mnt)\\({}_{2}\\), Cu(bdt)\\({}_{2}\\) and Cu(bds)\\({}_{2}\\).",

Also, while the slopes of the Cu(bds)\\({}_{2}\\) complex would suggest longer coherence times, the lack of spin echoes at higher temperatures can be attributed to the significant decrease in the vibrational frequency of the \\(a_{lg}\\) parent mode due to the mass effect of the S to Se conversion (e.g., 387 vs. 199 cm\\({}^{-1}\\), respectively).

As shown in Sessoli et al.[13, 53], six coordinate V(IV) complexes do not exhibit long \\(T_{I}\\)s at elevated temperatures. Very recently, Albino et al.[13] pointed to the role of increased excited state SOC in six coordinate complexes relative to vandyl complexes. Furthermore, Fataftah et al.[33] compared six coordinate V(IV) complexes to Cu(II) complexes to suggest the role of increased covalency in elongating \\(T_{I}\\) relaxation lifetimes. Here we have extended our LFT model to the V(bdt)\\({}_{3}\\) and V(bds)\\({}_{3}\\) complexes studied by Fataftah et al.[33] (Table 6). Interestingly, as pointed out by Albino et al.[13] for other six coordinate V(IV) complexes, the V(bdt)\\({}_{3}\\) and V(bds)\\({}_{3}\\) complexes exhibit very low energy calculated ligand field transitions (7935 and 6785 cm-1, respectively). Furthermore, the totally symmetric stretches of these complexes were computed at 351.7 and 209.8 cm-1, respectively. These modes allow for a quantitative comparison between the linear spin-phonon coupling term of Cu(II) complexes on a A-1 scale. The linear coupling terms for V(bds)\\({}_{6}\\) in the g\\({}_{\\parallel}\\) and g\\({}_{\\perp}\\) regions are -0.420 and -0.357 g/A, respectively. For comparison, the linear coupling term of the totally symmetric \\(a_{lg}\\) parent mode of Cu(bdt)\\({}_{2}\\) is smaller (0.232 g/A). Also, the calculated vibrational frequency decreases and the linear coupling terms increase going from V(bdt)\\({}_{3}\\) to V(bds)\\({}_{3}\\). Thus, the longer spin-lattice relaxation time at higher temperatures for Cu(bdt)\\({}_{2}\\) vs. V(bdt)\\({}_{3}\\) is not due to differences in ligand-metal covalency, but rather stems from efficient excited state SOC as a result of the relatively low energy ligand field transition energies for V(bdt)\\({}_{3}\\). This is further supported by the observation of room temperature coherence in vandylcomplexes,[37] despite ionic ligand metal bonding. Together, these DFT/TDDFT calculations are consistent with the LFT model derived here and further highlight the importance of considering both excited state SOC and ligand-metal covalency when comparing different complexes with different metals and/or coordination environments.",

In 2015, [16]carbobielcene (A) was synthesized by Murase and Fujita, and this is the longest [n]carbobielcene ever synthesized (Figure 1).[5] The synthesis of longer helicenes has been desired simply as a synthetic challenge and various improved synthetic methods have been devised.[1-6] Helicenes comprising more than triple-layered structures are particularly difficult to synthesize, because of solubility issues, and because the middle-layered core is tightly compressed, making it difficult to release the strain. Recently, several longer helicene analogues that can release the strain by virtue of their structure have been developed. For example, expanded helicenes, in which phenanthrene units are partially replaced by anthracine units to increase the diameter of helicenes,[6] and perylene bisimide-incorporated helicenes (helicene nanoribbons) have been synthesized.[7] These \"diameter-expanded\" helicene analogues display interesting dynamic behavior and chiroptical properties. Tilly's group synthesized expanded [n]helicenes (B) with three different lengths (n = 15, 19, 23), and compared the racemization barriers and dissymmetry factors.[8] By contrast, Hirose and Matsuda have reported \"n-extended\" [n]carbobielcenes (C) with three different lengths (n = 5, 7, 9), and compared their chiroptical properties, aromaticity, and ultrafast dynamics in the excited state.[9] As another type of helicene analog, heterobielcenes, in which heteroatoms are embedded into the helicene backbones, have also attracted attention because of their excellent luminescence and redox properties.[10; 11] Generally, heterohelicenes are more electron-rich compared with carbobielcenes, thus their HOMO energy levels are continuously destabilized with the n-extension. Therefore, it is more difficult to synthesize longer heterohelicenes with full conjugation, whereas several heterohelicenes with a double-layered structure have been synthesized; one example is diazatri-oxa-[13]helicene D.[12] Furthermore, a triple-layered structure was accomplished with oxa[n]helicene E (n = 17, 19) albeit with disrupted n-conjugation.[13] To qualitatively evaluate the electronic properties of helicenes, however, it is necessary to systematically synthesize fully conjugated heterohelicenes of different lengths, therefore, a synthetic strategy toward longer heterohelicene would be indispensable. Currently, few systematic synthetic methods are available for the synthesis of heterohelicenes.",

Longer helicenes are hard to make because they don't mix well and their middle part is tight. People found ways to make them bigger, like by adding other parts or changing the rings. Some of these bigger helicenes show fun actions and can help us learn about their electronic properties. But, we need more ways to make even longer ones with all the parts joined together. Right now, not many ways exist."

Inspired by this molecular design principle, we report a synthetic challenge for longer azahelicenes with outer-pointing pyrrolic NH sites. By exploiting the one-shot oxidative fusion reactions of suitably designed indole-terminated acyclic oligopyrroles (_wide infra_), a series of benzannulated aza[n]helicenes were obtained. This structure is suitable for suppressing the elevation of the HOMO energy levels by virtue of Clar's sextet rule.[17] In other words, the designed benzannulated aza[1]helicenes are an ideal platform to accomplish longer fully conjugated hetero[n]helicenes with respect to solubility and stability issues.

In our previous study on the synthesis of dibenzoaz[7]helicenes, acyclic precursors like \\(\\mathbf{6_{7}}\\) were effectively utilized.[19] In this study, the extended analogs \\(\\mathbf{6_{n}}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{8_{n}}\\) were synthesized using Pd-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions, followed by oxidation with [bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo]benzene (PIFA) to afford a series of benzannulated aza[n]helicenes (hereafter referred to as [n]AH) (n = 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19). In the case of aza[n]helicenes with n = 9, 13, 17, aryl bromides \\(\\mathbf{3_{m}}\\) were synthesized by Pd-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions of excess amounts of 1-bromo-2-iodobenzene or aryl dibromide \\(\\mathbf{1_{m}}\\) with \\(\\alpha\\)-borylated indole 2 (Scheme 1). Next, aryl boronic acid pinced esters \\(\\mathbf{4_{m}}\\)-Bpin were synthesized via cross-coupling reactions of 3m with \\(\\alpha\\)-borylated pyrrole and subsequent Ir-catalyzed borolvation. Dipyrrole chloride \\(\\mathbf{5^{15}}\\) was coupled with a small excess of \\(\\mathbf{4_{m}}\\)-Bpin in the presence of 5.0 mol% XYhos Pd G2 and excess potassium carbonate in THF/H\\({}_{2}\\)O to afford the acyclic precursors \\(\\mathbf{6_{n}}\\). Finally, oxidative fusion reactions of the acyclic precursors with PIFA at low temperatures afforded the corresponding [n]AHs. For [n]AHs with n = 11, 15, 19, aryl bromides \\(\\mathbf{3_{m}}\\) were used as coupling partners. Tripyrrole diboronic acid pinacol ester \\(\\mathbf{7^{15}}\\) was coupled with a small excess of the synthesized aryl bromides \\(\\mathbf{3_{m}}\\) in the presence of 5.0 mol% XYhos Pd G2 and an excess of potassium carbonate in THF/H\\({}_{2}\\)O at room temperature to afford acyclic precursors \\(\\mathbf{8_{m}}\\) although the yields were moderate probably because of the competing protodeboronation reactions. Similarly, the oxidative fusion of acyclic precursors \\(\\mathbf{8_{n}}\\) by PIFA afforded [n]AHs. All six [n]AHs were purified using silica-gel column chromatography and recrystallization from THF/_n_-hexane in open air. All [n]AHs were characterized by 'H- and '\\({}^{3}\\)C-NMR, and HR-MS (See the Supporting Information, SI). 'H-NMR spectra of the obtained [n]AHs were measured in DMSO-\\(d_{6}\\) at room temperature with one drop of hydrazine monohydrate to prevent the generation of oxidized species.[19] For all [n]AHs, NMR spectra reflecting the \\(C_{2}\\)-symmetric structures were obtained. The terminal benzene protons (_indole-H_) shifted considerably upfield, indicating that these aromatic protons were located above other aromatic rings. Notably, upfield shifts in the signals in the aromatic region were observed as the helical length increased, probably because of the enhancement of anisotropic shielding by the \\(\\pi\\)-electron of the stacked aromatic rings (Figure S3-45).",

Fortunately, single crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis were obtained by slow vapor diffusion of _n_-hexane into solutions of [n]AHs in THF, acetone, or 1,4-dioxane. The structures are shown in Figure 2A in which the solvent molecules coordinated to the NH moiety via hydrogen bonds are omitted. Because of the sophisticated molecular design, intermolecular interactions between [n]AHs were not observed in any of the structures, thereby contributing good solubility. Indeed, five and seven acetone molecules were included in the asymmetric units of [13]AH and [15]AH, respectively, (Figures S5-4, 5-5) whereas seven 1,4-dioxane molecules were included in the asymmetric unit of [19]AH (Figure S5-7). For [9]AH, the vertical distance (interplanar distance) between the centroid of terminal benzene ring A and the mean plain of the opposite terminal benzene ring I is 3.807 A. As the typical distance of \\(\\pi\\)-stacking is approximately 3.4 A, interlayer interaction between the terminal benzene rings may be minimal, similarly to that of [7]carbobilecene (3.8-3.9 A).[20] The interplanar angle between the stacked two benzene rings is approximately 40\\({}^{\\circ}\\), which also suggests that the interlayer \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interaction is weak. By contrast, for [11]AH, the longest and shortest vertical distances are 3.567 A and 3.202 A, respectively, suggesting a distinct interlayer \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interaction between the stacked aromatic rings. The interplanar angles are 16.3\\({}^{\\circ}\\), 11.6\\({}^{\\circ}\\), and 20.4\\({}^{\\circ}\\), being smaller than that of [9]AH in accordance with the effective interlayer \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions. The crystal structures of [13]AH and [15]AH are also shown in Figure 2A. As the space group is _P3\\({}_{2}\\)_ for the former and the lattice contains only one enantiomer, spontaneous chiral resolution took place for [13]AH upon crystallization. Chiral separation using HPLC apparatus is discussed later. In [13]AH and [15]AH, the shortest interplanar distances are less than 3.2 A (3.199 A and 3.176 A), and the aromatic rings are very closely packed together, again confirming the existence of effective \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions. The smallest interplanar angles are 3.3\\({}^{\\circ}\\) and 1.4\\({}^{\\circ}\\) for [13]AH and [15]AH, respectively. These values are even smaller than those of [11]AH. The crystal structures of [17]AH and [19]AH are the first examples of triple-layered fully conjugated heterobilenes. In both [17]AH and [19]AH, the shortest interplanar distances are also less than 3.2 A (3.170 A and 3.185 A, respectively), and the smallest interplanar angles are the smallest of those measured (1.2\\({}^{\\circ}\\) and 0.8\\({}^{\\circ}\\)). The interplanar angles at the ends are larger than those of the helicene central core due to the effect of electron repulsion and smaller steric constraints ([19]AH; \\(\\theta_{\\rm{A}}\\) = 19.5\\({}^{\\circ}\\), \\(\\theta_{\\rm{BN}}\\) = 0.81\\({}^{\\circ}\\)). However, at the center of the helicene core, the angles are almost 0\\({}^{\\circ}\\), because the central layers of [17]AH and [19]AH are located under large steric constraints from the top and bottom layers. After six types of crystal structures were obtained, their structural parameters of them (interplanar distance, interplanar angle, and dihedral angle) were compared with those of the obtained structures calculated at the B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-SVP level (Fig 2B).[21, 22] For all the parameters, the trend of the experimentally determined values agreed with those obtained from the theoretical calculations, which reproduced the notable changes from [9]AH to [11]AH. This result reflects the weak intramolecular \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions at the terminal aromatic ring of helicenes. A decrease in the interplanar distances or angles results in an increase in the dihedral angles, indicating that the intramolecular interactions become stronger and the aromatic rings become more densely stacked with helicene elongation, while the strain energies of the [n]AHs increase with helicene elongation. To estimate the inherent strain energy of [n]AHs, we attempted to adopt a homodesmotic reaction model.[23] Accordingly, the strain energy (_AH_) of [n]AHs increased continuously as the number _n'_ increased (Figure S7-12). These estimations are in accordance with several cases of expanded helicenes previously reported.[60] Finally, the interlayer \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions of [n]AHs between the two neighboring layers were visualized using the noncovalent interaction (NCI) plot analysis (Figures 2A and S7-11).[24] Dispersion interactions between the two stacked layers of [n]AHs are obvious (green surface shows intramolecular \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions). In particular, intramolecular \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) interactions across three layers was confirmed for [17]AH and [19]AH.",

The longer [n]AHs exhibited negative potentials at -0.06 V for [11]AH, -0.16 V for [13]AH, -0.26 V for [15]AH, -0.38 V for [17]AH, and -0.48 V for [19]AH. The negative shift in the first oxidation potentials can be attributed to an increase in the number of electron-rich pyrrole units in the helicene core. In particular, [19]AH was confirmed to be very easily oxidized. Nevertheless, the as-synthesized [19]AH was purified using flash chromatography on silica at room temperature and recrystallized from THF/_n_-hexane, allowing the growth of single crystals under ambient conditions (_vide supra_). Molecular orbital calculations were performed for the optimized structures of [n]AH in the ground state (Figure 4). The HOMO energy level gradually increased as the helical length increased. By contrast, the LUMO energy level was not markedly affected by the elongation, resulting in a gradual decrease in the HOMO-LUMO gaps. To gain further insight into the structure-property relationship in these benzannulated aza[n] helicenes without benzannulated structures (_i.e._, [n]AH) were also calculated (Figure S7-8).[25] The HOMO energy levels of [n]AH's are generally higher than those of [n]AHs by 0.11-0.37 eV (_e.g._ -4.45 V for [19]AH vs -4.18 V for [19]AH).

To this end, targeting aromatic residues such as tyrosine[12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18], tryptophan[19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27], and histidine[28, 29, 30] have become an attractive protein labeling strategy (Figure 1a). In addition to direct protein labeling, functionalization of these residues can be leveraged for novel peptide modification strategies. In particular, this can have important implications in the development of novel peptide macrocyclization and stapling techniques, whereby two or more sidechains are cross-linked to generate new topological architectures valuable to the medicinal chemistry community[31, 32, 33, 34, 35].",

Another approach is to utilize isodesemic reactions (IDRs) which are error-canceling reactions that can be constructed systematically as shown by Buerger et al.

When comparing the approaches, we find that both BAC types yield results of similar accuracy, though the Anantharaman and Melius-type BACs seem to generalize better. Further, although the IDRs approach is often as accurate as the BAC approaches and sometimes even more advantageous, we find that this method appears to be less robust than the BAC methods.

Moreover, many species (especially radicals, but not exclusively) cannot be isolated conveniently for experimentation. Due to the importance of these parameters, several databases exist that provide high-accuracy thermochemistry data. One widely used database is the Active Thermochemical Table (ATcT)[1, 2], which aims to produce a self-consistent set of species thermochemistry with continually improving accuracy. When data from ATcT or other high-quality experimental sources are available, they represent the preferred route for obtaining the most accurate thermochemical values of a species of interest.

However, to realize the accuracy gains, it is well-known that energy corrections are needed in addition to the QM calculations to reduce residual errors present from the given level of theory (LOT). Usually, atomization energy corrections (AECs) are needed to correct for the large systematic errors in the computed absolute energies of atoms, and to connect the computed zero of energy to the standard state zero of energy used when defining the enthalpy of formation (a.k.a. heats of formation) \\(\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{f}}\\). As we show later in this work, if no additional corrections are used, the resulting \\(\\Delta H_{\\mathrm{f}}\\) tends to have a fairly wide distribution of errors, often not centered around zero.

BAC methods assume that the residual error from QM calculations can be attributed to errors associated with specific types of bonds within a molecule. Further, the errors associated with a particular type of bond (e.g., a C-C single bond) are assumed to be largely consistent across various molecules that contain the same bond type. Therefore, a correction value can be fitted for each bond type found in a collection of reference molecules, and the total bond additivity correction is simply the sum of these corrections for every bond in a species of interest. In this work, we focus on two popular implementations of BAC: those of Petersson et al. [7] and those of Anantharaman and Melius [8]. For brevity, below we call the Anantharaman & Melius' BAC's \"Melius-type\" or \"m-BAC\", although we note that Melius had success with several different types of BACs during his long career [9].

If the reaction under consideration was an isodesmic reaction with respect to these atom and bond types, then these systematic errors exactly cancel. However, since we have excluded the target species from the summation in Equation (5d), the atom and bond types present in the target molecule have not cancelled. In this way, the summation in Equation (5d) can be viewed as calculating corrections similar to AECs and BACs for the chemical features (e.g., atom type, bond type, rings, charge, multiplicity, etc.) present in the target molecule and then applying these corrections.

One disadvantage is that if a reference species included in the isodesmic reaction has a large uncharacteristic error, this error will affect the final result much more than if a larger reference set was used for training. One way to mitigate this error sensitivity issue is to take an average or median of values obtained from multiple isodesmic reactions. Another method to allow better error cancellation is to choose species that are chemically similar to the target when building IDRs. Finally, constraints could be placed on the species of an isodesmic reaction to ensure that the bonds present in the reaction are similar in nature to each other, and thus should have similar cancellation of errors.

Take single C-C bond of ethane as an example, where the carbon atoms on two sides of this bond both have a coordination number of 3 (notice that by convention the carbon-carbon bond in question is excluded from the calculation of coordination number). However, for the single C-C bond in propylene, the \\(sp^{3}\\) carbon atom has a coordination number of 3 but the other \\(sp^{2}\\) carbon atom only has a coordination number of 2. Therefore, the C-C single bond of ethane and propylene are treated as different bond types.

In ethane and propylene, the sticks connecting the carbons are counted differently because one has 3 hands and the other has 2.
